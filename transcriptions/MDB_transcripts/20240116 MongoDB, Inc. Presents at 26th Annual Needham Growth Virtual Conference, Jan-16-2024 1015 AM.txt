Prepared Remarks
Michael Joseph CikosNeedham & Company, LLC, Research Division · Senior Analyst
Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. My name is Mike Cikos, I'm the lead analyst here at Needham covering infrastructure software. With me, I'm pleased to say we have the management team from MongoDB, CFO and CEO, Michael Gordon; as well as SVP of Finance, Serge Tanjga. Thank you to both of you guys for joining us today. We really do appreciate the support to the Needham Growth Conference.
Michael Lawrence GordonMongoDB, Inc. · COO & CFO
Thanks for us, Mike.

Question and Answer
Michael Joseph CikosNeedham & Company, LLC, Research Division · Senior Analyst
And I know we're going to be tight on time here, so we're just going to just tackle it right up front. But one of the things I received a decent amount of inbounds on obviously, has been the December security incident. Just to kick it off, can you kind of put any parameters out there as far as how extensive the unauthorized access was with respect to the customer base as well as just set the table, I'm sure not everyone is following the blogs like I was, but anything else you could put around that, that would be great.
Michael Lawrence GordonMongoDB, Inc. · COO & CFO
Sure. Yes. Thanks again for having us. Happy to dive right into it, and let's start with that. So as we shared, we were the subject of a phishing attack, they gain access to certain of our corporate applications. The unauthorized person got access primarily to customer contact info and other account-related information. We found no evidence of unauthorized access to Atlas clusters or the Atlas authentication system. Those are 2 different systems.
So that's sort of important to note. At this point, our investigation is complete and closed. And so I think that's sort of the quick headline. I know these are somewhat common and unfortunately, increasing common events across the landscape. We tried to take a very transparent approach with customers and everything else. And so from within a matter of days of getting -- determining that there had been that unauthorized access, we alerted customers and, therefore, kept the public abreast with various updates on our alerts web page and everything else and have got a number of kudos from customers for doing that. So that's a quick summary.
Michael Joseph CikosNeedham & Company, LLC, Research Division · Senior Analyst
And maybe just from a logistics standpoint, but is it fair to assume then that there might be incremental costs related to the forensic partners on the security side of the house or cyber insurance, non-GAAP-ing that out? Like how do we think about that?
Michael Lawrence GordonMongoDB, Inc. · COO & CFO
Yes, nothing material. I mean, obviously, yes, when you're responding to one of these, you have some incremental costs that you had intended. We did retain third-party help, et cetera, et cetera. But as of right now, nothing that we would attend to non-GAAP out or anything like that.
I think from a materiality standpoint, obviously, you've got to run through all the assessments everything that while we disclosed it publicly that was more because we're disclosing to our customers rather than because it was material financially.
Michael Joseph CikosNeedham & Company, LLC, Research Division · Senior Analyst
Understood. And thank you for the qualifier on that. Want to shift to consumption for a second. But just so the audience knows, and I know I'm going to be moving around a little bit, but there should be a chat box on your interface. So if you want to send in a question, feel free to do so. I'm going to try and get to as much as I can, while we have Michael and Serge here as well. But please send those questions in.
On the consumption. So again, just taking a step back, can you help us think about the consumption trends that we've seen through calendar '23? And really, I guess, what occurred in Q3 versus your expectations? And how did that influence your assumptions when thinking about the Q4 guide?
Serge TanjgaMongoDB, Inc. · Vice President of Finance and Business Operations
Maybe I'll take a first step at that, Mike. So I'd actually start a little bit earlier than fiscal year '24 or calendar '23. So starting in the late first quarter of fiscal year '23 for us, so calendar '22 effectively. We're starting to see a macro induced slowdown in consumption. And we were among the first people to call it out. Incorporated in our guide and so forth. And we've sort of done it before, it really started, because we saw enough evidence at the end of Q1 to make it a part of our Q2 guide than in Q2 of last year, so at this point, 5 or 6 quarters ago, we did see that slow down materially. And since then, we've had periods of seasonal strength and seasonal weakness.
And frankly, some just natural variability in the numbers, and we've tried to kind of be transparent along to wait and give investors sort of our latest thinking. But now with the benefit of [indiscernible], if we look at that period, effectively starting in Q2 of fiscal year '23, through Q3 of fiscal year '24 and also how we thought about guide for Q4 is we've seen a relatively stable environment, just the growth was at a lower level. So there will be periods of strength like the back half of Q3 tends to be seasonally strong. There will be periods of seasonal weakness like around the holiday season. And we try to take that into account when we provide guidance. And certainly, when we provide commentary in terms of how we've done vis-a-vis our expectations.
But generally speaking, there's sort of like a range of consumption outcomes and if you might recall, we showed that chart at our Investor Day, that kind of shows on consumption. And a certain level before Q2 and then at a lower level on average since then. And yes, there's variability around that average, but we've been in kind of that slower stable world since there.
So let's just take a general construct. For Q3, now we're in a world in which we have been in the world of lower macro for more than a year. So what we're trying to do is give you color versus our expectations, but also versus last year. And you should expect that we'll kind of continue doing that going forward. But in Q3, consumption trends were in line with our expectations. We did see a seasonal recovery in Q3, meaning seasonally because Q3 was stronger consumption than Q2. However, the seasonal recovery was not as strong as it was in Q3 of last year.
Now you might ask yourself, okay, well, if it was not as strong as last year, why did you expect that? And the reason why we expected that is because generally speaking, we are seeing less variability in consumption in fiscal year '24 than we did see in the back 3 quarters of fiscal year '23, and we have some reasons and hypothesis of why that might be the case, but that's what we're observing. So as a result, we sort of thought that we would have more -- less of a seasonality benefit in Q3, and that's what it's transpire.
When it comes to Q4, two things to keep in mind. One is that we told you in December that we expected to see a seasonal holiday slowdown that plays out through December and January. That's usage-based like everything else in our model. Usage -- underlying application usages will drive our consumption growth. And we just see application usage take a breather in the -- during the holiday season, and that drives our consumption growth as well. And then another thing that we called out when it comes to Q4 guide, which isn't a consumption phenomenon, but is important as you think about revenues is, it relates to unused commitments.
So in Q4 of last year, we talked about several million more than normal unused commitments. That happened because, frankly, that was the last big batch of customers that kind of signed committed deals before macro slow down. And as a result, on average, there was more than normal unused commitments. That was important to call out, particularly when it comes to sequential guide and how people thought about the beginning of this year. But the thing to keep in mind is that we have unused commitments every quarter, it's a normal course of business. It's a minor portion of our business, but it's always there.
In Q4 of last year, we had more of it, and that's why we called it out in the context of Q4 performance of last year. Now as you think about Atlas year-over-year growth rate or sequential growth rate for that matter in Q4 revenue. You got to keep in mind that last Q4 benefited from several million dollars incremental of unused commitments and we do not expect that to reoccur this year.
Michael Joseph CikosNeedham & Company, LLC, Research Division · Senior Analyst
Got it. And you're already answering my next question. So just to tease that out, again, as far as quantification, we haven't gotten anything more specific, but $7 million. And then it is something that impacts your each quarter, but the reason for the call out specifically in Q4 last year was because it was larger than what you guys typically experience.
Serge TanjgaMongoDB, Inc. · Vice President of Finance and Business Operations
Yes. And just to be clear, we didn't say 7, we said several.
Michael Joseph CikosNeedham & Company, LLC, Research Division · Senior Analyst
Several, several. Okay.
Serge TanjgaMongoDB, Inc. · Vice President of Finance and Business Operations
So it turns out that the bid-ask spread of several is larger than we thought it was, but as specific as we got it, so we're going to stick with that.
Michael Lawrence GordonMongoDB, Inc. · COO & CFO
I think you got this, Mike, but just for the full audience, that's sort of the incremental, the several million is the incremental over and above what we kind of normally would have expected or sort of normally see with that, given the dynamics that Serge talked about where you've got people who had commitments before macro slowed down and therefore, we went up as kind of disproportionately more.
Michael Joseph CikosNeedham & Company, LLC, Research Division · Senior Analyst
Got it. And maybe to tease out one more item on the consumption, but we actually hosted another consumption rev rec model based company last week, who's actually talking about a potentially steeper than expected drop ball in relation to Christmas, because Christmas this year ends up on a weekday instead of a weekend. Is there anything that you guys have seen again -- I'm trying to think because we're all in this new consumption environment, trying to figure out how these holidays flow through these consumption models?
Serge TanjgaMongoDB, Inc. · Vice President of Finance and Business Operations
Yes. We haven't specified in terms of the size of seasonality we're expecting to see in Q4. The thing that I would say, though, is our underlying source of variability might be different than other people. And this is where like you've heard Michael and me say in the past, if consumption is not a business model consumption is revenue recognition sort of requirement. And so the driver for us is the underlying application usage. So literally, as you just think of yourself as a person who interacts with apps as a consumer and then interacts with apps in your place of business, you just do less of that during the holidays.
You also do less of that during the summer. And then when you're back in the fall, you do more, I mean, which is why you see positive seasonality in the back half of Q3 and that's what we just see around the holiday. So what they do on the week doesn't really matter because people don't work on Christmas or we wouldn't pause it that it would matter for us. And so as long as people are taking vacation as long as they're using those vacations to detach from applications in their life, we see a slowdown in usage and therefore, a slowdown in consumption growth for us.
Michael Lawrence GordonMongoDB, Inc. · COO & CFO
I do think it's an interesting point, though, Mike, to your comment, and I know a lot of people are trying to understand or [indiscernible] the trends or understand it at a deeper level. And without standing up on our soapbox to Serge's point, just because it's a common reference model, it doesn't mean that the business model is the same. And so I think for any company, it's a good idea to sort of ask that question or probe further and say what is driving that underlying usage in consumption, right?
And so for us, to sort of this point, I don't think it happens topically a matter of time where Christmas falls in terms of days of the week. And for others it may, right, if you're -- if it's -- if the consumption is driven by analysts deciding to run queries and those analysts are on a holiday or not on a holiday or this that or the other thing like that will all affect things just like -- but ours is at a more sort of fundamental read-write-transactions in the database.
And the beauty of having as diversified the portfolio as we do, is you can't just pinpoint and say, "Oh, it's this one thing." We're all about e-commerce and so we get this bump here or this low here, we've got a portfolio of applications not just given the size of our customer base, but given the breadth of use cases, but it does have some of these underlying seasonal trends that Serge is talking about.
Michael Joseph CikosNeedham & Company, LLC, Research Division · Senior Analyst
Got it. And two points I'd like to highlight with respect to, I guess, population of workloads as well as the Atlas versus EA. And so first on workload population, what I'd say is like while the growth of underlying workloads was impacted by this macro downturn over the last 12 to 18 months, right? I think management has been consistent in saying that the number of net new workloads being brought to MongoDB has been relatively consistent or persistent. And so where I'm going with this, is it fair to think that there's this large volume of orphaned applications, if you will.
And so if the macro were to improve or the consumption environment were to improve, that is this cohort of applications should torque higher at the same time like you get a springboard effect naturally. Is that a fair characterization? Or is that maybe overstepping or mischaracterizing?
Michael Lawrence GordonMongoDB, Inc. · COO & CFO
So I think -- I don't think of us as having orphaned applications or certainly not having -- if I follow the logic train, more orphaned applications as a result of macro. Here's some way that I would describe it and the way that, we've talked about it is that we have done a good job despite the more challenging and uncertain macro environment and continuing to win new workloads. The value [indiscernible] resonates and we continue to bring those new workloads on board and have been satisfied with that progress. The growth of existing applications has grown more slowly, and that's this read-write underlying usage dynamic that we're talking about that sort of macro affected.
And in the shorter term, when you think about a large installed base, in the shorter term, the results will be much more dictated by the growth of existing applications than the impact from new workloads that you win. Over time, right, if you take a 5-year time horizon, it's going to be much more affected by the new workloads that we're winning now over that time period than the growth of existing. But in the short term, we grow the existing sort of outweighs that. We haven't seen a dynamic like I said, that would lead to some sort of like orphaned application or whatever. And if you want to explore that topic, we can definitely talk about it more. But that's not something that we've seen.
Certainly, new applications, new workloads or applications -- and so while they ramp more rapidly than your average application, they grow more quickly in those first couple of quarters than an existing application. They are macro affected, right? And so they are growing at a slower rate than on quarter X than a new application would have pre-macro, right? And so that's a dynamic. And certainly, the last thing, and maybe this ties to your kind of [indiscernible] question or part of the question or whatever, but is we've sometimes been asked about inflection points and reacceleration and things like that.
And I think what we've seen is we've been in a pretty consistent and stable macro, and so to point to an acceleration from here, I think you have to believe in an improvement in the macro, there are other scenarios as well that can lead to that. But for this conversation, the one in some of the most relevant would be an acceleration of macro. We haven't seen the macro get better.
We haven't seen the macro get worse. So we have no reason to call that when we think about our guidance, that hasn't been a call embedded in our guidance. And obviously, we'll continue to monitor things, and in March, when we give our full year outlook, we'll kind of update it with the latest that we have done, but that's kind of how we think about it.
Michael Joseph CikosNeedham & Company, LLC, Research Division · Senior Analyst
Okay. And again, on the Atlas versus EA that I wanted to address as well. And again, I just want to make sure I'm not mischaracterizing this. But like when I look at customers that are bringing workloads on to EA, I think management has been consistent in saying, "Hey, we're going to meet you wherever you are in your cloud journey, yes."
Like my view is that if you're bringing a workload to EA, it's just an on-ramp essentially for workloads over the long term that are probably eventually going to end up on Atlas. And again, is that fair? Or do you say, hey, there's regulatory constraints or maybe it's just a modernization effort that's not necessarily the case.
Michael Lawrence GordonMongoDB, Inc. · COO & CFO
That narrative that you're describing of sort of EA increasingly being viewed as an on-ramp to the cloud. I do think is correct. That doesn't mean that 100% of workloads will move to the cloud, right? You can talk to different customers and that there are plenty that are still on-prem or mostly on-prem. We shared at our Investor Day the ARR from our top 100 customers, and we kind of broke it down into who is mostly EA, beating 80-plus percent of their ARR is EA or mostly Atlas, 80-plus percent or more of their ARR with Atlas. And 85% of the dollars are one or the other, right?
And so people -- while there is an increasing hybrid world and those kinds of things. The people who are running EA really are not in the cloud, they are concerned about it. To your point, it could be for regulatory reasons. There's a whole longer list of reasons, could be data privacy, government sovereign, a whole long list of reasons. And in those places, can you find developers who are frustrated that they can't modernize or do things? Absolutely. One of the ways that they can start to modernize is by picking MongoDB, right? And even if they're still running it in an on-prem fashion, they're doing a bit more future proofing and they're getting closer to their ultimate end goal for whenever they can kind of adopt public cloud.
And I think we've also seen that evolution in the other way where maybe a few years ago, moving to the cloud and modernizing were viewed as a little bit more synonymous than they really are. And I think people realize and understand that sort of adopting the cloud is just sort of one aspect of that. And then there are many other aspects to modernizing. And so we see people pursuing it in all different flavors.
Michael Joseph CikosNeedham & Company, LLC, Research Division · Senior Analyst
Okay. And shifting over to product now, right? So I think Vector Search is the first one I wanted to tackle. MongoDB announced that Vector Search was in preview in June. In our view, I think one of the things that MongoDB strikes to say is you guys have done a great job. Let's say, featurizing or integrating newer technologies as they become available, right? And that's kind of established you guys as a general purpose database.
Atlas Vector Search became generally available in early December. Just to start off with there, but how has customer feedback been? And then secondly, have you guys thought about maybe the percentage of customers that Vector Search is applicable to? Anything you could do to frame that out?
Serge TanjgaMongoDB, Inc. · Vice President of Finance and Business Operations
Yes, maybe I'll take a first step at that. So what we've said really even before GA, which was early December, so a few weeks ago, is that we've been very pleased with the feedback that we're getting from customers. And incrementally, what I would say is pleased that there's been sort of like a third-party validation of that feedback. So we mentioned the retool survey, but there are sort of other things we've heard indirectly from people that gave us the highest NPS score of all the Vector Atlas products.
And that was because -- sorry, that was before we went GA. Now you might ask you, that's an unusual state of affairs, right? The most like product isn't actually yet even generally available compared to all the other alternatives that are out there. And I think that fundamentally speaks to the value proposition that we're bringing to the table. And the value proposition is the simplicity of working with our Vector Search offering because it's seamlessly integrated with the operational database.
And that demonstrates -- that speaks; a, to the value of the product, but indirectly speaks to the pain of having to stitch multiple individual services together to create this offering, which if you're going with stand-alone Vector Search solution, you would need to be doing, right? So I think that the validation that we're getting is for the work that we've done, but also for like really understanding what is the pain point. And the pain point is operationalizing this and making it easier for the developer to actually deploy and get some value from it.
I'll just maybe side bar before I get back to Vector Search [indiscernible]. What I particularly like about the retool survey and the fact that it kind of demonstrates sort of the value of our product market fit and sort of the specific value of our value proposition is that it actually applies more broadly, sort of related to your point, to other things that we've added to our portfolio, whether it is traditional search, whether some of the stuff we've done at the edge, whether it is analytics.
Ultimately, customers don't want to have these multiple point solutions. They don't want to deal with the pain of integrating them in the background. And ultimately, the developer data platform vision is all about making the developer jobs easier by solving more and more of the developer problems that relate to data in the sort of behind a single pane of glass and sort of with an elegant developer experience. And it's kind of great to see that, that value proposition resonates in a space that is particularly a focus to customers and investors right now and where we're so early on [ AI ], this was done before we even had the GA. So that's on the traction. The second -- when it comes to like how broadly applicable it would be, I guess the only thing I would say is 2 things. One is it's very, very early days. Most of what we're seeing in AI really sits in the proof-of-concept category as opposed to deployment of actual production applications. That should not be a surprise.
And not only is it not a surprise because AI even they might not feel their way to the investor community, it's still a relatively new priority to your enterprise IT executives. Secondly, they are increasingly realizing that their data is not ready to really help them build AI-enabled application. That's an opportunity for us in the long term, but that's like the first impediment sort of to kind of think about a typical enterprise in their data estate. So it will take some time. The thing that we have said, and again, this is exceptionally important, but really in the long term is like we see most absolutely one way or another be AI-enabled, whether new ones or rebuilding the existing one, but that's like over a really, really long time horizon, but obviously an incremental benefit to us.
Michael Lawrence GordonMongoDB, Inc. · COO & CFO
Yes. I think it will become -- this requires a look out in the future and from [indiscernible] a little bit. But if you just think about where applications are likely to go. It won't be the core part of every application to Serge's point. But I think this will be pretty common feature functionality, and we've used the example that there was a point in time when indexes from a database standpoint were innovative, right?
And then they just became used as part of everything, and this has an aspect that's like a reverse index. It will be used in every single application will be the core of every single application. But I think it will be pretty foundational over time to just how applications are used much like tech search or other things. And so I think how to get integrated in your operational transactional database is an advantage for us.
Michael Joseph CikosNeedham & Company, LLC, Research Division · Senior Analyst
And probably more of a tech-based question, like a 2 quarter though. So when a customer brings a workload to MongoDB for Vector Search, like when is the data being vectorized? Is it upon ingestion? And then the second part is like when is the embedding model then being employed? Is that like when the query is being called? Again -- sorry I'm just trying to figure out how this process flows.
Serge TanjgaMongoDB, Inc. · Vice President of Finance and Business Operations
Yes. Maybe I'll take a first step of that. So actually, both the data and the query need to be vectorized, and in both times is the embeddings model use. So the way it works is if the application is ingesting data, what they're actually creating it or getting it from an S3 or somewhere. At that moment, it's vectorized and at that moment, you use like a third-party API, you access an embedding model, you create the vectors and then you store them into MongoDB. So that's like step number one.
Step #2. Now there's a query. There's an actual question. There's an [indiscernible] architecture use case that's being applied, and there's a question being asked. You need to vectorize that question using the same embedding model so that you can do nearest neighbor search and actually find the data that is in the multidimensional space, more similar and most relevant. So it happens in both times.
Michael Joseph CikosNeedham & Company, LLC, Research Division · Senior Analyst
Okay. And I know we do have some questions that are coming in from folks, one of them just at a high level, but how should we think about how much more consumption-intensive AI or vector search workloads are, versus, I guess, the workload we've seen more traditionally?
Serge TanjgaMongoDB, Inc. · Vice President of Finance and Business Operations
Yes. So we've heard that question before. And I would say 2 things. One is it's early. So it's kind of difficult to draw any conclusion based on where we are in the process of development of that. But secondly, what I would say is I'm not sure that will be the major driver. And what I mean by that, will we've seen over and over again with other applications is that it's the popularity of the application that really drives the intensity of usage as opposed to the usage itself.
So if you have 2 video games on our platform, of which we have many, and one is a worldwide phenomenon hit, and the other one is just another video game. The order of magnitude difference between the usage of those 2 use cases is what drives the consumption much more so than like take all the video games on average versus all the other workloads on average and try to figure out like sort of what's the incremental uplift for like the usage intensity of the video game.
So really, the question is going to be how popular are the use cases going to be? How many of the really popular ones are going to end up on our platform versus somewhere else. And that's going to be the bigger driver to sort of average uplift for music.
Michael Joseph CikosNeedham & Company, LLC, Research Division · Senior Analyst
And if we just shift over to Atlas Search nodes, which also went GA alongside Vector search in December, just for background for the folks, but it allows customers to scale Vector Search workloads, which can have more demanding memory requirements independent of transactional workloads. And so I wanted to get a sense here is search nodes -- is that inherently tied to adoption of Vector Search? So the two go hand-in-hand, or not necessarily?
Serge TanjgaMongoDB, Inc. · Vice President of Finance and Business Operations
So primarily, the independent search nodes are driven by actual traditional Dex search, if you want to call it that. Because where we come with sort of the evolution of that product. So if you go back to our search announcement, it was in calendar 2019. And obviously, we're sort of disrupting that space where there's legacy players, and it's a very well established market and one that's existed for a long time. And kind of like a traditional disruptor, we start with relatively small use cases because, again, our value proposition is the integration.
And then as our product is improved, we're kind of moving up market slowly in the search market. And we've now gotten to the point where we see enough of the large search use cases, not Vector Search, traditional search use cases, where we heard from customers that feedback that independently tuning their search deployment, separate from the operational deployment will be beneficial to them. And so that's why we announced a separate search notes because it will allow them to scale the surge separately from operational, which is sometimes helpful and certainly allows them to better optimize their use cases and then the deployments.
Michael Joseph CikosNeedham & Company, LLC, Research Division · Senior Analyst
Is that why -- like I know, again, the company has discussed being able to run 60% faster query time in search nodes. Is it because of that independent scaling or not necessarily?
Serge TanjgaMongoDB, Inc. · Vice President of Finance and Business Operations
So I don't honestly recall where the 60% number comes from. But either way, you're right, like we do expect that the queries will be more efficient. And generally, the search deployment will be more efficient. It comes down to 2 things. One is, you now have separate resources, so they're not in contention, right? Like it's not one single cluster or no that's trying to do both operational read-write operations as well as search. So it kind of goes to it stands to reason that with more resources, there will be more efficiency and better performance, right? So that's number one.
And then number 2 is back to sort of what I was saying, which is like if you have a separate search node, which is only used for that. Now you can optimize how it's being used, specifically for search, and that ought to do better than again, if you're trying to bring the shared resource. So it is going to be better performance and it's going to be more cost-effective for the customer.
Michael Lawrence GordonMongoDB, Inc. · COO & CFO
Yes. I think of them as both beneficial related but slightly different, right? I think the performance is the performance. And I think that the cost, which some people can include as part of the performance, but in this case, I'm breaking out the cost is different. So part of what you would had -- maybe the simplest way to think about it is by having separate search nodes, to Serge's point, you can scale up or down the search nodes separately from your operational notes, which, depending on if you're less search intensive, more search intensive, allows you to better optimize price performance along that continuum in a way that is advantageous to you. It's kind of a contour of your workload.
Michael Joseph CikosNeedham & Company, LLC, Research Division · Senior Analyst
Okay. And sorry, the last product here. It says you guys got a pretty robust road map coming over the next year, but stream processing, right? So has the company given a sense for when that's expected to become GA? And then secondly, just to flush it out while we have you, but can you discuss why tying stream processing to the database is the way to go in your view. Others would have you believe that stream processing should be its own independent engine.
Serge TanjgaMongoDB, Inc. · Vice President of Finance and Business Operations
Yes. So I'll take that to start, and Mike will feel free for you to add, obviously. So we haven't specified when we expect the GA to come out. If you look at our history, it tends on average to be about 12 months after it's been in preview, not to say that, that's AAA forecast or anything like that, but that gives you sort of like the mean outcome compared to history. And hopefully, that's a little bit helpful.
And then on this question of tying, what do you tie stream processing to. It's not necessarily how we think about it. We saw a problem space in stream processing that we thought we could -- we had a unique right to play. And what I mean by that is streaming data tends to come with rigid schema, not there able flexible. We hear time and time again how developers are struggling to work with it. It's a massive market, right? It's a massive market in the sense that like there's no TAM that you can go and ask Gartner, IDC about it. It's a new -- even the sort of the established players are relatively small in the grand scheme of things. We think part of the reason why it's massive is because it's hard to work with streaming data with existing solutions.
But outside of that, we saw a lot of similarities with sort of the state of the database market when we decided to start the company and try to disrupt that market, which is difficulty working with data, rigid and flexible schemas, opportunity to both provide better performance as well as make the developers more productive. So those are the pieces. And on that level, we find great similarities between stream processing today and where the database market was like 15, 17 years ago when we started and the problem that we try to solve. So we're very, very excited about like sort of our individual right to play in this market, given our history and success that we've had with the document model. That's point number one.
And point number 2 goes back to what we were talking about even in the context of Vector Search. So now if we're going to build this product which we think we can build a better mousetrap individually in another self. We're going to, in addition, make it easier to work other products, right, and have a unified developer experience and make it so that developers don't have to tie together too many individual technologies. And we think that, that works for all our products, and because they're -- what's the word, seamlessly integrated with all our other products, all to help the adoption of all of them at the same time. That's ultimately sort of the business rationale, if you will, behind the developer data platform.

And Serge, maybe on just 2 seconds talking about the difference between stream processing and stream kind of plumbing.
Serge TanjgaMongoDB, Inc. · Vice President of Finance and Business Operations
Oh yes, sorry, that wasn't obviously....

So stream process. Streaming is a far more established market, which we sort of refer to as the infrastructure or the plumbing of moving data around the real-time. Stream processing is advanced operations and building that data inside the applications, which is still a relatively new market, while streaming obviously, has been around as many companies participating, and the Kafka ecosystem is reasonably well defined. Stream processes is different and very, very new.

Right. Okay. And just to be true to my earlier comments, I'm going to start introducing some more of these client inbounds we've received. First, is there any rule of thumb on a multi-quarter basis with the degree of Atlas acceleration we should expect relative to average AWS or Azure acceleration. It sounds like people are looking at you guys versus the hyperscalers and thinking is there a ratio like there are for maybe some other consumption names out there.
Serge TanjgaMongoDB, Inc. · Vice President of Finance and Business Operations
Yes. We got the question once in a while. We understand that some of the broadly defined consumption peers find this as a helpful sort of rule of thumb for their business model. We don't think it's very helpful for us. Like ultimately, at the end of the day, we are driving the sale of our product. We keep our hand in our -- faith in our own hands. We partner very closely to the cloud providers, but it's not that AWS sends us buckets and buckets of workloads to sign up on our platform. They're also a competitor, don't forget. And so we think that there is no like fixed multiplier of if the AWS growth is this, then MongoDB is going to be in this type of range.
And of course, generally speaking, if the cloud adoption, as a general rule goes faster or grow slower, like there will be some correlation between the business models. But it's nowhere nearly as precise as like, let's put a ratio or even like a relatively narrow range. That's because ultimately would drive out on sales.

And then the other question that we received was, as you guys shift away from a focus on big upfront commitments, which I know we haven't even had time to touch on the go-to-market here. But you've obviously seen headwinds on deferred revenue because you're prioritizing consumption now. How long is that headwind on deferred expected to last? Is this a multiyear item? Or is it more just a couple of quarters? How close are we to getting through the other side of that?
Serge TanjgaMongoDB, Inc. · Vice President of Finance and Business Operations
Okay. Let me just provide a lit bit of background then address this for a revenue question. So as you know, Mike and his most investors know, we've been on a multiyear journey to reduce the importance of upfront commitment in the Atlas business. And this began in calendar 2020, actually, before COVID, because frankly, we saw in the data, the commitment introduces unnecessary friction to our sales process and slows it down and probably provide some optimal customer experience and therefore was not additive to us from the purposes of maximizing long-term value. But there was a number of steps on that journey, since 2020. But in the fiscal year '24, the year that we're about to finish here, we did arguably the biggest one, which is that we no longer pay on 1-year commitment.
So you can be, a, so far, up until this point, we made it more attractive to get paid on consumption, but still paid on commitment. Whereas this year, we say, oh, no, commitment, 1-year commitment, you don't get paid anymore. You signed a $5 million 1-year deal. It doesn't matter you will still only get paid on consumption related to that deal. And so why do we do that? Because again, with large commitments, we saw that there were still a source of friction and misaligning us with our largest customers. And now that we've built multiple years of success and showing to our reps that there's a reason why we're doing this, and they will still do well and the company will do well, we kind of took this big step.
So that started at the beginning of the current fiscal year. And it sort of went the same way we see other changes, which is, the fiscal year begins, you roll out the change in your comp plans, you enable the sales team. But it's usually not until a few months later that you actually start to see changes in behavior because they need to internalize it. They need to see they are in commission track, and then you start to see the impact. And the impact is, frankly, we see far less Atlas commit. That's not surprising because our reps are not pushing it. And so to the extent that it's still happening, it's because customers are pushing for it. And they're pushing for it because -- particularly on a 1-year basis because they hope they can get some incremental sort of discounting benefits, but those are really de minimis.
So as a result, we neither party particularly interested, you see a huge decline in commitment. And so you've seen that -- and really the first time we've really seen that it was in the second quarter of this year and sort of the gap that we've seen between the op income and the cash flow line. Like I said, this sort of started this year but it didn't really pick up pace until later in the year. So we would expect that to continue to be an impact from this range going into fiscal year '25.
Michael Joseph CikosNeedham & Company, LLC, Research Division · Senior Analyst
Understood. And just last point here, and then we'll leave it. But is it fair to think, given -- I know you've been on a multiyear journey with this, but last year was a big change, right, for the sales organization. So are there any learnings or anything we should keep in mind, again, when thinking about comparisons, whether on a revenue consumption basis and then new workloads or sales payout that occurred last year, which may not be recurring this year?
Serge TanjgaMongoDB, Inc. · Vice President of Finance and Business Operations
No, not really. I would say that we've -- because it wasn't our first change, we've learned a decent amount about change management and how to implement this and roll this out in fiscal year '24. And that's frankly the reason why you do it over multiple years. You do it to build conviction that you're doing the right thing, but you're also doing it to like demonstrate to the sales force, like why you're doing it, and there's a rationale for this. And so -- and it wasn't actually terribly disruptive, given the size of the change that it was not in terms of sales attrition or anything like that.
So it was a big change. You see it flow through the financials. We also see it on the volume of new workloads, which is where we started the conversation and how good we feel about that. But as you think about like what does that mean in terms of compares or mechanics of the financial model for next year, nothing particular to call out.

And we'll leave it there. I do want to be honest about that last question. So thank you very much, guys. I really do appreciate the time today.
