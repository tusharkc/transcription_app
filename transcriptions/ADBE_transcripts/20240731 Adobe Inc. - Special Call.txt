Prepared Remarks
Matthew John SwansonRBC Capital Markets, Research Division · Associate Vice President
All right. Welcome, everyone. Good morning, and thank you for taking some time out of a busy earnings week to spend some time with us. I'm with VP of Investor Relations at Adobe, Jonathan Vaas. I'm Matt Swanson. I'm one of the software analysts here at RBC, and just a big welcome to Jonathan.
Jonathan VaasAdobe Inc. · Vice President of Investor Relations
Thanks. It's always a pleasure hanging out with you, Matt. I'm glad to be doing this, and thanks, everyone, who's tuning in.

Question and Answer
Matthew John SwansonRBC Capital Markets, Research Division · Associate Vice President
Yes. So I think we're going to spend a lot of time today on GenAI, on the product set and a lot of the things you're doing, but from maybe a wider industry perspective right now, it seems like the 2 big topics are the GenAI narrative and the macro sentiment and kind of how those are interrelated. Maybe to start off, can we just talk a little bit about what you guys are seeing from either the macro or the demand environment?
Jonathan VaasAdobe Inc. · Vice President of Investor Relations
Yes, for sure. It's -- that's been a dynamic one, and it's one where every company pays a lot of attention to what is everybody else saying. And then sometimes you hear from other companies, saying what you've been saying. So I'll just remind folks of what Adobe is kind of -- how we've characterized the macro in Q1, how we characterized it in Q2.
I mean it's definitely been an interesting ride, I think, really since -- gosh, I mean, going all the way back to COVID but certainly since 2022. Enterprise software sort of has gone into this phase of when enterprises' growth rates have slowed, they've really been more focused on profitability. And so we've talked about scrutiny around spend, scrutiny around budgets.
I think right now, ROI is everything to enterprises, so they're going to be spending on things that have a really good ROI case to not only drive their top line but also produce efficiency. So we've talked about that budget scrutiny for, I want to say, a couple of years now, and that's something we've heard from other companies.
Adobe always, when we talk about the enterprise, talks about how we're really diversified -- and when we talk about diversification, we mean geographically. We mean in business models. We mean in customer segments. So there's -- we look at what the pure-play enterprise companies are saying. We look at what some pure-play SMB or consumer companies are saying.
Adobe, what's -- makes us resilient as a company is we play across all those segments. So we're kind of able to use a data-driven approach to lean into strength, to lean away from weakness with how we invest and where we focus. Q1, I would say, for Adobe, this year was one where we talked a lot about success in the enterprise. So I think while we would certainly agree with that characterization of a lot of scrutiny around budgets, we've adapted really well to it, and I think enterprise was really kind of a hero segment for us in Q1.
And then in Q2, we talked a lot about digital being an area of strength. That means small businesses and consumers. So I think if you look at -- what we said in the Q&A of our Q2 report, that was the first time in a while we talked a lot about some strong demand in small businesses. So I think a lot of people looked at our commentary from Q2 and saw maybe some improvements macro wise or in terms of the demand environment coming from small businesses.
We're not out of the woods yet, but I think Adobe has been optimistic. We think if we do get past this high rate, high inflation environment to a declining rate environment, we think that there should be a more accommodating macro where businesses get back to growth investments, and that should be good for our markets and for our demand.
So it's been exciting. Resilience for Adobe has been a good thing. And hopefully, that optimism comes to pass here not too long.
Matthew John SwansonRBC Capital Markets, Research Division · Associate Vice President
Yes, that's great. And just as a reminder to investors on the call, feel free to submit questions through Veracast or e-mail directly. But I'll start with one more on my own kind of echoing some things me and Jonathan were talking about before this call started. Outside the Olympics, the thing we were talking about was, in the past 2 years, we've seen sentiment kind of shift back and forth for investors around GenAI, but internally, I'm sure the investment strategy is much more linear. Could you just talk a little bit about maybe the biggest points of confusion or topics of conversations with investors on the topic of GenAI?
Jonathan VaasAdobe Inc. · Vice President of Investor Relations
Yes. One thing internally we talk about a lot as we invest, and we've been investing for several years in these technologies, are people tend to overestimate impacts of big inflections in the near term and underestimate how transformative they'll be on the world in the long term.
And when we look back at the dawn of the Internet or cloud computing or mobile, I think those things certainly hold. And so this is one where we think there's been a lot of hype and controversy around what AI means, and I think for investors, sometimes that means next quarter or next year. And when we really think about our addressable market and the opportunity, we're thinking a decade out. But we think we have a lot of conviction that this has increased our addressable market and ultimately can be a growth inflection driver for Adobe.
So I think our internal commitment in terms of where we're investing and where we place these priorities has been very, very clear, but it's been interesting to see how much confusion there might be every quarter or every announcement or every time you see a new AI model do something cool. And what I would ultimately say is we believe -- you can ask, is GenAI replacement for things that humans do or does it augment and aid things that humans do.
We've all played around with ChatGPT or diffusion models for long enough to know. I think by and large, these things are helping us, augmenting us, but the human is the pilot, right? That's why a lot of companies are going to use that word, a copilot. And so I think the biggest point of confusion is when people see a prompt into an AI engine produce something cool, they worry. Is the future going to just be people typing prompts until you get something cool? And our belief is these things -- these AI technologies, if done correctly, can be deeply integrated into applications people use to be super controllable.
We have an idea or our client has an idea or our client's CEO has an expectation, right? And people need to be steering to make that happen. And it's too much of a wildcard to just keep typing prompts until you get something you like. Ultimately, though, with the aid of the ideation and the variance that AI can produce, it's a huge augmentation of what's possible. And I think Adobe is way in the lead in terms of thinking about this problem of not just making cool AI outputs to show it in a better -- pick the best 10 that you got, and put it up on the stage and impress people. But make these things super controllable or toolable, so you can tweak in different ways to make humans really in charge of where you're going with this stuff.
And I think it's a harder technological problem to make AI engines toolable the way Adobe is really thinking about it. And over time, I think people will see how far we are in the lead in that way and what a big opportunity that unlocks for us.
Matthew John SwansonRBC Capital Markets, Research Division · Associate Vice President
That's really helpful. I'm going to mash up one of my questions with an investor question here. And thinking about the monetizable benefit, it seems like Document Cloud is one of the areas that we've highlighted as maybe an early beneficiary in the second half. Could you just talk a little bit about what you're doing in Acrobat? And then the investor question specifically was more around what the contribution has been from the generative assistants?
Jonathan VaasAdobe Inc. · Vice President of Investor Relations
Yes, that's a great one. I'm glad we're hitting Acrobat early because it's Adobe's fastest-growing business and doesn't get enough attention. Think about PDFs as a file format. First of all, to frame this, PDF is one of the most ubiquitous file formats in the world. I often tell investors, if somebody sends you a document that's not a PDF, you assume they either sent you a draft or a virus.
So this is the way we exchange documents. This is the way people open documents and consume them. And there's a massive productivity uplift if in the moment of document consumption, AI can just sort of say, like, hey, what do you want to know about this document. Would you like a summary of it? Like would you like to know the top 5 like takeaway points to put right into an e-mail? Adobe uses this now every time we send colleagues PDFs. We just put the AI assistant summary, right, in the e-mail.
So it's a huge time saver, and it's a way that people can get much more quick insights from long documents or even collections of documents. So I think the -- it's an example of where owning the workflow, owning the interface of how people interact with a PDF means that we have that strategic high ground to put the productivity uplift right then because could you copy and paste a very long PDF and go to a different large language model and put it in and have an -- you can do these things, but I think you lose the productivity unlock when you go back and forth between tools.
So big opportunity. We started actually selling GA this AI assistant in the middle of Q2. It's a $5 add-on. So it's not consumption-based. It's just a -- would you like fries with that model. When they buy Acrobat, we say do you want to check this box. Do you want to give us an extra $5 a month for all of this productivity?
And a tremendous amount of people in our digital checkout flow are checking the box. To me, it's really persuasive evidence against this bear case that people aren't going to be willing to pay for generative AI. They just think of it as table stakes. And we're seeing a lot of people willing to pay for it, and that's super exciting.
There's this other even bigger opportunity for us as we encourage the user base, this is over 0.5 billion monthly active users, to start playing around. We give a little bit of these conversational AI assistant interfaces away for free every month and then get them understanding the productivity unlock and making that up purchase.
So that's a huge TAM. I can't break out the specific number that it contributed in Q2, but I've told investors, if it wasn't there in terms of the net new ARR, you would have missed it. It was enough of a contributor in the quarter that it certainly contributed to a nice beat against our guide, and we're really bullish on where it can go from here.
Matthew John SwansonRBC Capital Markets, Research Division · Associate Vice President
We'll do another mash up here of an investor question. So the investor question is how AI-related CapEx will impact your return on invested capital and revenues associated. And I'd like to pair that with kind of the talk about generative credit. And just the consumption model, right, would be kind of the natural CapEx offset, but we've taken a little bit of a different strategy. So if you kind of just talk through both those.
Jonathan VaasAdobe Inc. · Vice President of Investor Relations
Yes. So my expectation for Adobe on CapEx is that our CapEx, which is quite low, grows slower than revenue. And that's in part because we have not been looking to build our own data centers to do all the training and inference. We're a very, very large customer or partner with the big hyperscale cloud providers through our enterprise software. I mean we have such a broad deployment on Azure and AWS and NVIDIA. And so we have very large agreements with all of those, which gives us, I think, good pricing to roll the training cost into R&D for Adobe.
So when you look at our R&D, we're certainly investing hard in the people and the GPUs to train these new models. And then as we scale these features and our products and it turns into inferencing, that shows up in COGS, in our gross margin. If you look really closely, you can see those expense line items that are at our scale, I think, the movements on any line item on our income statement are pretty small. And part of the reason is that Adobe has always been really disciplined.
So when there's an area where we need to spend more to fund these sorts of things, we really look hard at other parts of our business. And where can we save? Where can we renegotiate deals or do different kinds of payment structures to get better pricing? And also our digital experience business is expanding margin and expanding particularly gross margin over time to help offset some of these costs.
So going back to the question. I don't think you should see a material impact over time in terms of return on invested capital. But when you look -- if you just think about our gross margin, it should be able to remain relatively flat as digital experience expands to help fund the inferencing we're going to need to spend on digital media.
And on an operating margin basis, there's a lot of leverage that comes out of the increased health of the business of when people use GenAI, the top of funnel is more efficient with product-led growth. Engagement and renewal rates improve, and so we think over time, you'll see a very healthy margin, which still has room to expand.
Matthew John SwansonRBC Capital Markets, Research Division · Associate Vice President
Another question for investors. Could you talk about the competitive dynamics in the mass market area? So not high-end enterprise, thinking maybe more on the consumer side. they're specifically asking about Canva, but if I could, as always tack on another question to it, something I've been thinking about, the difference between the TAM in terms of headcount in consumer and the TAM in terms of wallet share in consumer. Just kind of that paid versus unpaid and how you think about going both of those and the competitive environment.
Jonathan VaasAdobe Inc. · Vice President of Investor Relations
Yes. I'm going to start by talking about something people ask about a lot, which are all these other AI models. OpenAI has Sora, which can create videos from text or there's Midjourney, which can create images from text, things like that. But Adobe, we view -- any diffusion model where you can type in something and get content whether it's still content or moving content, we view that as a replacement for cameras.
So Adobe has always had deep partnerships with camera manufacturers to make it really easy to get your content from a Canon or a Nikon or Olympus or Panavision, professional video cameras, get it into our products to do editing and complete a project. We view any AI model, including Firefly, as really replacing the need to do a physical shoot, to do a virtual shoot with these virtual cameras. And you will increasingly see Adobe partnering with other AI models to really make our products, our editing platform an ecosystem or a platform where our users have choice. We'll make Firefly models, which are commercially safe, the default, but to allow them to bring in content from other models that they can then take advantage of that controllability and editability that we have in our products.
And so we really do view this as a content ecosystem that's expansive. We found, with the proliferation of this video and photo device in everyone's pocket, that more and more content was a good thing for our business. And we think that is going to happen with all of these AI models. So on the margins, Firefly for that inferencing may be competing with other models, but what we really want is people coming to our products to become content creators and learn to edit.
And so you'll see, I think, even later this year, Adobe keep -- continuing in that direction of making it easy for our customers to bring different models into our ecosystem. The other place that we really compete at the lower end for the consumer, this expansive TAM, is with Adobe Express, and you mentioned the big competitor there. I think historically, Adobe only really played in the high end, and there were lots of democratized low-end free tools, Microsoft Paint, clip art.
If we all think about our own professional lives, most of us, whenever we needed a piece of content, didn't create one or hire a creative professional. We just kind of went online and found a picture and copied and pasted it. So the proliferation of easier-to-use tools like Express and AI, I think, takes all of those people, think of all the knowledge workers of the world or all the Internet users of the world, that's 5 billion people, and potentially activate this creative intent, where instead of going online to search for an image, they can just describe the image they're looking for and AI makes it.
And then we can bring them into Express, which is now fully replatformed as an AI-first application, to sort of let them like just think about the basic starting blocks of becoming a content creator. Add your own fun. Add your company's logo. Do simple things and share it on social.
So I think it's a new TAM for Adobe. It's one where we weren't -- we weren't first to the space. In terms of getting templates online -- people starting with templates, that's something Canva did really well. And for the last decade, starting with the template and editing, it was kind of the way to go.
We think the next decade won't be as much about templates. Templates are kind of slow. A human creator has to create each one. We think AI first is the way that market is going to go. Whoever has the best AI tools to make people be able to take a picture of their cat and put it in outer space and move things around and publish it out to their Facebook page, that's going to be kind of the winning equation.
And we think we have the best AI-first application out there, so now we're really going to be aggressive about starting to sell that both in consumers and small businesses and enterprises. So we're excited about having these big new markets that we think are validated enough that we're convinced they can drive a lot of growth. And we're starting to see -- particularly in emerging markets where we never quite have cracked the nut on monetization, we're starting to see a lot of new customers coming to Adobe. So we're excited about where we sit.
Matthew John SwansonRBC Capital Markets, Research Division · Associate Vice President
And I think you answered this question but just something that comes up sometimes. Have you guys given thought from a TAM perspective of generative images and generative content versus generative editing and kind of where the long-term value line is between those?
Jonathan VaasAdobe Inc. · Vice President of Investor Relations
Yes. I think the content is mostly in the consumer space, where people are -- the same people that were just scrolling through Google image search, looking for an image to use will now be just typing some prompts to get something good enough to -- for whatever their school project is or their work presentation. I think that's a big new TAM, and that's the 1 where we talk about 5 billion global Internet users are what we're going after.
And the place where Adobe historically has competed, which is creative professionals, businesses, enterprise workflows, those folks aren't looking to replace anything they do with AI-generated outputs. Shantanu will often say to investors, "I don't think Steven Spielberg is planning his next film with a bunch of prompt engineers. He's looking for known talented actors, producers, directors and shooting something to match his vision."
AI can be a tool in that, where if there's -- I mean, I remember watching all the Lord of the Rings extended features and learning about when they -- when there was a continuity error and they had to -- somebody flipped around a badge on the cloak. They had to go reshoot the whole scene. Well, we can fix that. AI can flip around the badge. And so AI can do a lot -- I mean there was a Game of Thrones, where there was a Starbucks coffee cup on the table. AI can jump in and help out, right? So I think in the world of enterprises and professional content creators, it's very much an editing tool. It's an ideation tool on the front end, but more importantly, it's a tool to drive variance, localization and personalization.
So for example, Adobe in our own like fall campaign, I think all of our agencies and creative professionals created around 100, what we call, hero assets. But we -- to do all of our localization and personalization to -- we're not targeting 10 segments. We're targeting 10,000. We turned those 100 hero assets in over 100,000 variants. Firefly services and AI did that. There's not enough creative professionals in the world to do that for every business. And so it enables things that weren't possible before, and then end users can get content that's much better tailored for them.
So I think the TAM and the opportunity is totally about the editability, the controllability, the variance. Those are the hero cases right now. And those are the things that businesses are actually asking us for. They're not saying like, "Hey, we don't want to go shoot B-roll of a bird on a tree. We'd rather type prompts until we get a nice one." B-roll is easy, right? That's not -- nobody is trying to solve that. They're trying to solve much more challenging problems with scale and speed.
Matthew John SwansonRBC Capital Markets, Research Division · Associate Vice President
And when we talk about kind of the strength of your editing suite, which has been a long-standing part of the Creative Cloud, one of the questions we got from investors were basically talking about that embedded knowledge base you have within the industry. But as AI makes these tools easier to use, does that enhance or hurt your competitive moat? Basically, does the 20 years someone spent on Adobe make it more entrenched? Or does it make it easier for them to switch to someone else that the onramps are easier?
Jonathan VaasAdobe Inc. · Vice President of Investor Relations
We found as we make -- so this isn't theoretical. We've done it in Photoshop. Photoshop is a complex product. It's one I've been using since I was 17, and I still learn more about it every day. But when we made Photoshop much easier to use with this AI-assisted onramp, we sold more Photoshop, just period. More people stayed and went from trial to buy. Retention went up.
So we know -- it was -- I described what we saw in Photoshop as thesis confirming data that show that if you make these things easier to use, editing easier, people will do more of it, not less. So that democratization is a great thing for us, and we certainly want to bring more and more of that.
The other thing I would say -- I mean, there's a lot of ways in which the network of professional creators, the deep knowledge around the file types they use, collaboration between artists of different media types, there's all kinds of ways that our ecosystem really advantages Adobe in this way. So -- but I want to come back to something I said earlier. Making an AI model that's capable of producing some cool things that you can put up on a YouTube video and everyone says, "Wow, look how neat that is," that's one thing. But making those cool outputs super controllable, so people can actually do what they want with it is technologically, it's a different [ product ].
It's not just sort of like I'll spend some administrative time wrapping a tooling interface on top of it. It's hard to get these models to be -- to hone them and control them to do exactly what you want in a tooling ecosystem. And nobody else, to my knowledge, has -- is really trying to solve that other than Adobe. And so I think that's a really important differentiator between us. And I think as this plays out, investors will start to see how important that is to the big spenders, the agencies, the studios, the professionals of the world.
Matthew John SwansonRBC Capital Markets, Research Division · Associate Vice President
Going to another investor question, and this is maybe a little bit more broad than some of the products we've been looking at. But can you help give us a sense of what's driving confidence and visibility to the Creative Cloud growth in the second half? And what would it take for us to get comfortable with a $2.5 billion net new ARR next year? Is this the right way to think about the Creative Cloud business sustaining in the [ LDD ] zone?
Jonathan VaasAdobe Inc. · Vice President of Investor Relations
Sure. So let me first just remind folks if they might not be aware. We said in our Q2 call that the Creative component, we have digital media net new ARR, but the Creative component of that will grow based on our expectations in Q3 year-over-year and in Q4 year-over-year.
And I think investors have been really excited to see that happen. There's been some concerns. Will it happen? And based on all of these new products and underlying trends that we have that are ramping in the back half of the year and simple dynamics around the timing of some pricing changes in the portfolio. Effectively, we now have exited a tough comp on pricing in the Creative line item from the year ago quarter and have some nice pricing tailwinds with what we've been doing with the AI rollout.
So based on the way we've modeled the business, investors are going to see that back to growth year-over-year in Q3 and Q4. I'm not going to get into any kind of foreshadowing on 2025, but I really like the way Adobe's set up. With -- software companies always say we love having new things to sell. The enterprises are excited about, consumers are excited about emerging geography signals are really positive and even some pricing tailwinds. So I think it's a great setup for the back half of the year.
And the reason we're investing in all of these things is certainly because we think there's a big opportunity to drive an inflection on growth. And we said we're really focused on -- this is the first year we'll cross $20 billion in revenue. We're really focused on that journey from $20 billion to $30 billion, which we've been talking about for a few years now. So I think there's a -- it's a good spot to be in.
Matthew John SwansonRBC Capital Markets, Research Division · Associate Vice President
Yes. And you mentioned the pricing point. And to another investor question, obviously, we've kind of talked about Q1 headwind, Q2 tailwind. Q3, I think, was supposed to be even; Q4, to a tailwind. Fast forwarding kind of into FY '25. Can you just give us some color on how we're going to lap prices next year just so we're clear on when the tailwind subsides?
Jonathan VaasAdobe Inc. · Vice President of Investor Relations
Yes. So Adobe has been pretty thoughtful when we raised prices, first of all, to make sure that it's really driven by customer value. And we always like the benefits of our products to accrue disproportionately to our customers. So I think the price increases have been well received because there's so much value.
And then we're also thoughtful about kind of feathering in any pricing-related growth, which we've had pricing-related growth in our ARR since 2018 after we got through the original transition to subscription. We do it in a way that I think avoids any big lumpiness or -- and so for the AI price increases, they started in November 2023. It wasn't a full geographic rollout, and then we sort of extended some of the geographies as we've gone through this year.
So the prices that we've announced already will drive net new ARR in 2024 and contribute positively to net new ARR in 2025, so it's -- and then we've said those price increases related to roughly half of the Creative book of business. And so as we operate the business and we're looking at data between new customers coming in and upsell flows, there are other pricing-related changes that we can make as we operate the business or not. So I think we have -- it's something that we've shown as a core competency of being able to use pricing to help be that third leg of the stool to our growth algorithm. But certainly, we're more focused on all the new products and new customers, which are the primary drivers of growth.
Matthew John SwansonRBC Capital Markets, Research Division · Associate Vice President
Maybe staying on pricing but a little different aspect. A question from an investor was just when do you expect to start seeing some monetization from generative credits. And I know when you originally launched the tiers, the idea was that most people, based on usage trends, wouldn't be going over. And maybe it makes more sense for upsell, right, to the next platform instead of purchasing more. So is this something that more relates to the more compute-intensive models like video 3D vectors that are coming or kind of just what you're seeing right now?
Jonathan VaasAdobe Inc. · Vice President of Investor Relations
Yes. When we introduced the concept of generative credits, it's kind of we invented a new economy where we control all the levers. We do enforce the free-to-paid generative credit paywall. So if you're going on and playing around Firefly online or in Express, once you use your free allocation of generative credits, you had a paywall. So in that extent, it already is something we enforce that's driving monetization.
But within our paid plans right now, we're letting people play as much as they want. And I liken it to a video game arcade 30 years ago, where it was $0.25 for every game, whereas now if you go into an arcade, this one's 8 credits. This one's 6 credits. There's -- they're more complex experiences. And so that inflation is something we'll drive over time. And there's some more complicated models that are more compute intensive, like video [ come out ]. That will also drive inflation.
So it's something that we'll, at the right time, decide how we evolve credit allocations and credit enforcement. And also, I imagine, as some of these new models come out, there will be new ways we monetize it. And going back to Acrobat, rather than make it based on credits, we decided to initially make it a very simple $5 a month add-on. I suspect when our video models come out, we'll do some exploration and also have some flat fee SKUs that enable people who want to go really deep in video workflows to do all that complex stuff without thinking about credits per se.
So I think there's a lot of different places we can go. But initially, we knew we were planning for proliferation. The analogy I make is we're giving away a lot of free coffee in our apps and getting everybody a little bit hooked. And then eventually, we're going to bring out the higher-priced lattes and espressos and cappuccinos and drive a lot of upsell behavior.
And the great thing about coffee is I never begrudge who I'm buying it from because I'm the one who wants it. So when you -- when people are hooked on something they really enjoy, they're in control of when they want to buy more and use more. And I think that certainly applies to what we're seeing in GenAI.
Matthew John SwansonRBC Capital Markets, Research Division · Associate Vice President
Maybe a natural caveat off of that is without like the direct revenue contribution from credit, what do you think are the right line items for investors to be focused on when they're thinking about GenAI adoption? Is it digital media net new ARR as people are upselling seats and moving up? Or is it RPO for the Experience Cloud, seeing people create larger and more standardized buying patterns?
Jonathan VaasAdobe Inc. · Vice President of Investor Relations
We are going to start breaking it out. So Shantanu mentioned it at our investor event in March, but we are still internally deciding really precisely what we consider to be GenAI contribution. There are lots of different ways you can define it. You can define it really expands easily to capture increased benefits of better retention and engagement, things like that. You could define it really narrowly to just be pure GenAI SKUs like GenStudio for the enterprise or Acrobat AI Assistant.
So we're -- I would say we've made a lot of progress internally on having a point of view that's auditable, that our auditors can make sure, yes, this is, in fact, a hard metric. And then just like we do with ADP and apps, where along the journey from 0 to now over $800 million ARR, we've told investors, as we've grown and what the growth rates are, we'll start breaking out GenAI contribution very much in that way.
It certainly -- it's in revenue. It's in RPO, especially for the big enterprise deals. It's in ARR. And we are already seeing important levels of contribution to all of those. So I think for GenAI companies, there are very few big incumbents who have brought more technology to market, integrate it with their applications and are monetizing it today. We haven't started breaking it out yet, but like I said, we're going to be pretty close on that. And then I think that's something that investors will spend a lot of time focusing on.
Matthew John SwansonRBC Capital Markets, Research Division · Associate Vice President
Another investor question, skipping over maybe more to the Experience Cloud side for a little bit here. But they said Pinterest talked last night about its AI ad tech to create dynamic ad content personalized and optimized on the fly in real time for advertisers. Does this displace fixed ad content creation that advertisers would have used Adobe for? And maybe this is a good place to give some thoughts on the content supply chain management maybe that we talked about at Summit.
Jonathan VaasAdobe Inc. · Vice President of Investor Relations
Yes. So we -- I wasn't aware of that one, but we talk a lot about the walled gardens as kind of advertising platforms, the big ones being Google, Meta, even Amazon. So Pinterest, we'll put it in that bucket. They've always had simple tools to make it very easy for small companies to just sort of be an ad shop on their platform, going back years, going back decades.
We don't think of those as really being an Adobe's competitive set. So that -- any walled garden is always going to make it really easy to have some native tool, so people can create an ad and run it in the ecosystem. A lot of those companies are going to be small companies, dropshippers, things like that.
The level of complexity in alchemy that Adobe is solving for big enterprises, we've said our real-time data platform customers include Home Depot and Nike, Verizon, Coca-Cola. They don't want an AI-created ad running on Pinterest. Far from it. They want to absolutely control every aspect of their brand and their campaigns and then be able to create variants that run across all of these different platforms. And it requires a huge level of sophistication on content creation, training customized models that know Coca-Cola's brand, customer data to drive the personalization and delivery. And they do want to advertise on Pinterest. They do want to advertise on Meta, but they want cohesive brand experiences across those. And that's where Adobe plays. That's the big TAM.
We think we're really the only software company in the world that plays in the content creation and visual AI space and plays in that customer experience management space with real-time data delivery activation. So that's a big opportunity for Adobe. Yes, I don't think there's anything terribly relevant about what Pinterest is doing, but that's certainly -- and any walled garden should have some native tools to help small advertisers be able to do things like that.

Maybe staying on Experience for a second. It feels like over this last year, you benefited by GenAI. There's a more unified strategy than maybe we've ever seen before between Creative and Experience. And I was just curious if that's how it feels internally and then maybe how that's being reflected in your go to market.
Jonathan VaasAdobe Inc. · Vice President of Investor Relations
Yes, it does feel like that. For -- inside of the company, there's a real excitement around this because, frankly, we've been talking about it since Adobe acquired Omniture in 2009. I actually sit in the office in the Greater Salt Lake City area where Adobe is here because this is where Omniture was located.
So the heritage of that business, that was an online analytics targeting A/B testing sort of tools for enterprises. And so 15 years ago, Adobe believed if we can tie content creation to analytics and optimization of understanding the content and how it performs on digital channels, there's this virtuous loop that we can create.
It's been a long journey since those 15 years. And I think over time, there were some pieces of connective tissue that helped both sides of that business come together. Certainly, our content management business, AEM, was part of that connective tissue when we acquired Workfront. The workflow layer was a connective tissue.
But AI was kind of the missing piece. And now with generative AI actually able to create variants of the content based on customer data in real time to deliver to a very -- an N of 1 or a very small targeted customer segment, personalization and then have a feedback loop that filters back into the content creation, it's real. We're selling these deals today. We were selling GenStudio deals in Q1. We aligned the sales force to think about our customers with a one Adobe lens 4 years ago. After Anil joined, in 2020, we aligned all of the digital media and Creative sellers in the same sales organization with Digital Experience.
So we've been ready for this moment for quite a long time. And now I think we finally have the product truth, not the PowerPoint slide of the strategy but the real product truth aligned. And it's exciting to see enterprises using these Firefly services to do the same thing Adobe did, which is your creatives make the hero assets and then Firefly services informed by data can create hundreds of thousands of variants and drive true personalization.
So it's happening today. I think my optimism is if the macro improves for -- broadly in enterprises, so it's not just the largest enterprises in the world doing this but the top 2,000 or top 5,000 and they all start to invest in this way, that alone is a massive addressable market for Adobe. So I think it's exciting.
Matthew John SwansonRBC Capital Markets, Research Division · Associate Vice President
Maybe we stick on the personalized marketing component that you mentioned. Back to the Wayback Machine to when GenAI started. That was kind of one of the main areas we talked about that you had shown survey results saying that the desire for content creation was a lot higher than the current output. And that's why you thought that we could see no seat reductions even with these efficiency gains. Can you maybe just give us an update on that thought process on that seat count versus content creation? And then just to kind of -- yes, sorry. Anything about the Real-time CDP? Again, another thing that I don't think we talk about maybe as much as we should.
Jonathan VaasAdobe Inc. · Vice President of Investor Relations
I'll go even farther back in the Wayback Machine. The world I grew was one where -- so I think about big advertisers when I was a kid being McDonald's and Coke. And I recall that they ran 2 ad campaigns a year. There was pretty much -- there was a winter campaign where Coke might have had polar bears, and then there was a summer campaign. And these ads ran on billboards. They ran on linear television. And that was the content they created in a year.
So fast forward to today. There's 2 things that have changed dramatically, which is the need to create variance for personalization. So it was, I mean, just huge segments than they were targeting. Now they're targeting very, very precise targets based on demographic data, age, geography, language, [ some ] preferences about me based on my customer data. And investors miss shelf life a lot, which is marketers will tell you that the performance of content on advertising channels degrades after week one.
So once it's 1 week old, it starts to feel stale now. And so enterprises can't -- they can't keep up today. There's not enough creative professionals in the world to enable them to create that much content for all of these segments, the personalized and the short shelf life of content. That's why AI -- Adobe never could have produced 100,000 different images for our fall Black Friday ad campaign. Like all the machinery we have produced around 100 images.
AI is doing the rest of that work. And so we think seats will continue to grow and the performance of that personalization is just going to get better and better. We do think we'll approach a world where it is truly an N of 1, where I'm getting content that's just tailored for me. Not in a creepy way. These are brands -- like I think of my airlines, Delta Airlines, that I fly with a lot. I trust them. They know me. I want a one-on-one interaction. I want them to tell me, "Hey, we're sorry your flight got canceled last week," true story and like, "Here's a voucher. Have a free gin tonic on us for your next trip." I want that kind of experience. So I think AI, that's one way, again, where it's augmenting. It's not replacing.
The data platform, we built it from scratch. I think it was a really bold decision when we did that. First started selling it in early 2020. We shared in Q1 it crossed $800 million of ARR growing 60% year-over-year, and it's on our way to being a homegrown billion-dollar-plus business. It's -- in big enterprise, it is the only offering that works truly in real time. That means it assembles the content in less than 100 milliseconds now on average. So you can -- and enterprise can truly give you a personalized experience on the very next click as your app or your website loads.
And it's one where I wouldn't say there's anyone else at that level of data platform that we're competing with. We're really just talking to big enterprises about are they ready for this level of maturity in their digital transformation. And it's exciting to think about that business crossing $1 billion and where it can go from there. And it partners so well with this generative AI story that I really like Adobe's position because there are so many pieces to this puzzle where we're -- on an innovation perspective, we're really far away from major competitors.
Matthew John SwansonRBC Capital Markets, Research Division · Associate Vice President
And we've got a couple of questions. I want to kind of double click on the consumer market. So one of the persistent bear points on Adobe is the encroachment of prosumer tools like Canva or CapCut. And so the question is about when will Express start to more notably contribute to [ an N ] ARR and then if you'd be able to share more financial disclosures around Express or plan to in the future.
Jonathan VaasAdobe Inc. · Vice President of Investor Relations
Yes. I mean inside of the company, we feel -- like I mentioned, we've replatformed all of Express, both web and mobile on our next-generation platforms that are AI first and built for the next decade. So our view now is we have the best, most modern AI platform of anything in the market. And David said on our last call, now is the time to really pour some fuel on the go to market and go out and build awareness and start selling and monetizing this.
We are excited about reaching the scale where we're starting to break out financial contribution. Certainly, it's been a contributor to our net new ARR for a while now. But that's something that -- that's absolutely among our top 3, 4 strategic priorities inside of Adobe, and we're ready for the world to see what Express can do and what an AI-first experience in those markets can do.
Matthew John SwansonRBC Capital Markets, Research Division · Associate Vice President
And then this may cross over into our commentary around Pinterest. But the question was the AI studio and AI content creation tool to Meta, do you see those as a change in the competitive landscape.
Jonathan VaasAdobe Inc. · Vice President of Investor Relations
No, we don't. I would refer precisely to what I said about walled gardens and Pinterest. And in fact, Meta is a big partner of Adobe. They use a lot of our technology, and there's a lot of things we do together to enable AI experiences.
Matthew John SwansonRBC Capital Markets, Research Division · Associate Vice President
And then there were a couple of requests about your comments on Creative Cloud growth in Q3 and Q4 in terms of net new ARR and specifically, the idea of year-over-year growth with maybe Q4 currently with guidance implies to be a little bit more flat and just if there's any additional color on that.
Jonathan VaasAdobe Inc. · Vice President of Investor Relations
No, I don't want to get into what is sort of -- we haven't given Q4 targets. We updated our annual targets, and we gave Q3 targets. And I think there's -- I know that implies something about Q4, but there's a different level -- in our view, there's a different level of precision around a quarterly target and an annual guide.
And certainly, if you look back historically Adobe has a great track record against both, but particularly the annual guide. So we now have, I think, 1 month remaining in -- give or take, in Q3, and so we'll certainly, around the corner, give a much more precise view into what the business will do in Q4.
Matthew John SwansonRBC Capital Markets, Research Division · Associate Vice President
Perfect. Going back to some of the product areas, could you expand a little bit on Firefly services and custom models and just what you're hearing from the customers? And then just how much, I guess, is the training data deal breaker in this environment? I guess are you competing against people that are utilizing open web data sources? Or is that kind of off the table thing?
Jonathan VaasAdobe Inc. · Vice President of Investor Relations
Yes. So I'll -- let me talk even at a higher level of altitude about enterprise. There's kind of 2 ways to think about Adobe. One is the traditional seat-based business. It's P times Q. And in the world of P times Q, those are both still going up. So we talked about, in Q2, driving a lot of enterprise upsell as businesses sold to people that have Creative Cloud seats as they upgrade to the highest level of Creative Cloud that has all the Firefly capabilities for their Creative Cloud users. So that's driving growth.
But then there's something -- we call it V or value. These are big value selling based on new capabilities to automate content, create all those variants. That's the world of custom models and Firefly services, where we're saying to a Coca-Cola, which we did the demo on, we can take up this commercially safe, clean model. It's incapable of infringing anybody else's trademarks because it wasn't trained on them. And then you can bring your own brand-approved content to -- so the model can learn from and then you can create content and variance that's on brand for Coca-Cola.
There's APIs wrapped around everything we've done with Firefly and all that editability that really put enterprises in control. That's the thing where they're doing really big purchasing commitments with Adobe that's driven RPO acceleration, and they're getting started. I would say the kind of leading enterprises are saying this is something we have to start investing in.
I would say it's a huge differentiator for Adobe that we are not trained on the web because they don't want to accidentally get some Pepsi in their output. Like somebody drinking Pepsi to an AI model might look a lot like somebody drinking Coke. And so it's an absolute feature. Any really brand-conscious business wants to -- and their legal department wants to make sure there's no AI used in production that's going to actually go to something that's going to be delivered to an end user on a digital or traditional marketing channel.
So I think, yes, I like where we're sitting. I know some of the competitors say they'll indemnify enterprises. But frankly, enterprises don't care that much. They don't care as much about their legal bills being covered. What they care about is not getting sued, right? They care about their brand and the PR of making sure they haven't accidentally fumbled and put a Pepsi bottle in one of their Coke ads. So I think, for us, the strategy and the way it's playing out with enterprises is exactly as we envision.
Matthew John SwansonRBC Capital Markets, Research Division · Associate Vice President
Yes. Maybe going back to a comment you made earlier about generative content models being kind of like camera companies, right, where they utilize to make an output and then the output comes into Adobe. In some ways then, you could kind of see all these generative content creation as top of funnel for editing. And I guess does there need to be an explicit relationship? Because, I mean, similar to cameras, once the photo is taken, it's just a file format, right? They can get brought in if the user wants it to get brought in. What is your relationship like with the content generation companies? And do you think there needs to be one enabled to benefit from editing content creation?
Jonathan VaasAdobe Inc. · Vice President of Investor Relations
Yes. So it's a great question. There doesn't need to be one. So for example, there's lots of people who just take all of the photos or videos they've uploaded, drag it to a drop box drive, sometime later access the Dropbox drive and edit it in our tools. We know people -- we know a lot of people edit in Photoshop images that were created in a DALL·E or Midjourney, for example, or Stability.
But what we've also found is creating plug-ins, it just greases that process, right? So if there's a plug-in directly in an OEM relationship with a camera manufacturer, let's say, we're talking about video, that makes it super easy to access your content in Premiere. And all the other editors who are using that camera are using the same plug-in. That's something that just fuels people coming into your ecosystem.
And so that strategy holds for generative AI. We want to make it really easy for people doing exploration with other products to come in and be able to tweak it in our products. And so we think that's the right strategy. I can envision over time there even being a marketplace inside of our products where people can access and play around with different models.
And I think we envision the world as one where a new generative AI model company is really going to want to make sure they're part of the Adobe ecosystem because that's going to help them reach more users and get their model played with because I think we're entering a world where there's just going to be more and more models. They're going to have different strengths and weaknesses that David calls them personalities. And so we want -- and I think this is already true of the ones that folks have heard of. They want to partner with Adobe. They want to be part of our ecosystem because we have so many users. And so I think there's -- it's mutually beneficial to sort of enable that with plug-ins and in-product integrations.
Matthew John SwansonRBC Capital Markets, Research Division · Associate Vice President
And then I would say like an industry-wide perspective, we've heard a lot of initial deployments with GenAI needing to be kind of hyper ROI focused and basically, enterprises thinking, "Hey, our first investments need to get in the black to be able to get approval for more." Can you just talk about how that goes into your conversations with enterprise customers looking at these tools?
Jonathan VaasAdobe Inc. · Vice President of Investor Relations
I think it's true. And interestingly, this is kind of how we started the conversation talking about the macro. Big enterprises are investing. They have to, especially the very, very largest ones, and that scrutiny means they're really thinking about like where are we going to put our chips because they're not spending as many chips in this high rate environment as they might have 4 years ago.
They are -- so I would say GenAI absolutely is a priority. And ROI justification is a priority. And so I think businesses that are performing well, and this certainly applies to Adobe, understand that your sales pitch has to not only be how this is going to benefit your growth of your business but how it's going to pay for itself and really have some data and parameters around that to show how the productivity gains are going to be there and where the ROI is. I think Adobe has done well on both.
And the reason we're doing well in the enterprise is we find ourselves inside of the walls of that GenAI exploration. So there's -- most software companies have some GenAI pitch right now. But I think enterprises are really saying like what's the early GenAI exploration that we need to be doing now to be ready to scale it once this all plays out? And Adobe is also doing -- operationally, Adobe is doing hundreds of early experiments into using GenAI across our business to increase productivity, but it has to have that increased productivity piece.
It can't just be for giggles, right? So it all comes down to ROI. And I think companies that are struggling in the enterprise are failing on one of the -- one or both of those. They're either finding themselves outside of kind of early prioritized GenAI exploration or they don't have the pitch. It does require data to really help an IT department make a case to their CFO that this will pay for itself in terms of the ROI.
Matthew John SwansonRBC Capital Markets, Research Division · Associate Vice President
And then I think we got time maybe for 1 or 2 more. At Summit, we talked about increasing the overall TAM by 2027. And maybe from a high level, could you just talk about the major drivers of increased spend within enterprise? And then what do you think are the keys to determining who gains market share over the next 3 years?
Jonathan VaasAdobe Inc. · Vice President of Investor Relations
I think there's 2 big drivers of our TAM expanding. We showed this by up and down arrows, but I think that lowering the barriers to entry, the -- into content creation, that's the big democratizer. And the way I sometimes explain why this TAM expands into Adobe, I'll ask a lunch full of investors or knowledge workers, students and I'll ask them, "Hey, in all of your life, when you needed a piece of content, how often did you call a creative professional and hire them?" It's always 0, right, because we always just found something and copied and pasted it in.
That entire universe of knowledge workers and consumers who lived in this copy-paste world, now having tools that can actually make us produce a unique piece of content, is a massive democratizer in our market. We'll figure out how to monetize that over time. We're already doing -- starting to do that today. But that's one dimension of the TAM expansion. We call that lowering the floor or lowering barriers to entry. And then raising the ceiling is just making things possible for the power users that never were possible before either in terms of -- on the front end, the number of possibilities they can explore before they have to choose one and commit, that's ideation or all the variants, the personalization. With enterprises, with production studios, a lot of it also is going to be automating content production.
So think of all the probably billions of dollars spent on trucks and crews and equipment rental, lighting riggers, boom mic holder. Like to shoot a clip and now automate the production of that clip, that is a huge, expansive value for software. So traditional content production, some portion of all of that spend globally is going to shift to software companies. We think that's our opportunity to lose. I know there's other start-up companies who are looking at that same opportunity, but that's a massive TAM expansion.
And that goes back to that V for value. It's an enormous value to be able to get the starting point of content, not from traditional production but from software. And then, of course, it feeds into our editing ecosystem and all the things that the creative professionals do. So those 2 dimensions, we think, grow our TAM to -- in the realm of $300 billion.
Matthew John SwansonRBC Capital Markets, Research Division · Associate Vice President
All right. Well, that was a very good way end a really productive hour. Jonathan, thank you so much for joining us. Thank you guys so much for all the investor questions, super helpful. And if we didn't get to any of them, we will be forwarding them on to Jonathan and the team. But yes, thank you so much for joining us today.
