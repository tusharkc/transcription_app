Prepared Remarks
Mark L. MoerdlerSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division · Senior Research Analyst
Welcome, everyone. I'm going to give a couple of second, a little more than that for people to connect in, they're joining at a high rate. I apologize for being a couple of minutes tardy in terms of the start of this, and I look forward very much to our conversation in a moment. Let me give it just another second. I see a lot of people connecting in once that slows, we will get started.
Okay. Excellent. Welcome, everyone. For those who don't know me, I'm Mark Moerdler. I cover global software at Bernstein. I'm really pleased to have the team from Adobe on this call. I have Jonathan Vaas from Investor Relations; and Scott Belsky, who knows everything we could ever want to know about the creative side of Adobe's business.
Scott, I really appreciate you making time for us. We've created a pigeon hole which you should have a link for that. So if you have any questions, please put them there. I have some questions to start with, and I will be monitoring the pigeon hole and adding those questions.
Let me start at a high level, Scott. First of all, Scott, thank you very much for your time today. So Scott -- thank you. Can you explain DDOM, and why this is a differentiator in driving the business?

Question and Answer
Scott K. BelskyAdobe Inc. · Chief Product Officer & Executive VP of Creative Cloud
Sure. Well, DDOM stands for the data-driven operating model. It's really -- has been in our compass, you could say, as a company as we've driven the change from the kind of old perpetual model into the subscription model. And it's the way that we have become extremely intimate with our funnel, understanding where customers start when they discover our products and then when they come in and when they actually try the product, and how to optimize the trial experience that they buy. And then once they buy, how do we make sure that the usage is really strong and that we're optimizing for discovery of all the capabilities and then how do we retain. And I would say a newer addition to this over the last few years has really been this product like growth motion around how we make sure the customers also help us grow the product.
So we're not just getting new people at the top of the funnel and attritional branded search and nonbranded search and paid and whatever else, but that we also have the customers helping drive that flywheel as well.
What's interesting though about DDOM and Shantanu always loves to talk about what we call Adobe on Adobe, building Adobe on our own tools and building our own customer and when you are your own customer, you have the ultimate level of empathy and how to help customers get value out of your products and how to drive the road map going forward.
And so DDOM really drove our transformation as a company over the last 10 years. And so as we're thinking about other companies and other brands that are going under digital transformation of their own, one of the amazing thing to say, hey, we were customer zero. We learned and really built this for our own transformation.
And we're not selling something without empathy because we know exactly what it takes to implement this and to benefit from the DDOM model that is now sold through our products. And so they look to the future, I think about new things that we're now doing, Adobe on Adobe, like -- what we like to call internally the content supply chain by helping customers go from end to end in terms of creation to deployment of assets to optimizing and personalization. It's almost like deja vu, that's the new conversation of us being customer zero once again.
Mark L. MoerdlerSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division · Senior Research Analyst
So when you say customer zero, you're talking that basically you built on what became the marketing cloud, right? And experience cloud in terms of the technology and you really optimize to drive from the top of the funnel all the way down to assure that you close the client and make them successful.
Scott K. BelskyAdobe Inc. · Chief Product Officer & Executive VP of Creative Cloud
That's right. And making sure that we are their first customer and that we optimize it for ourselves and therefore, can confidently sell it in market and be great stewards of the product experience because as we said, like we had to go through this transformation ourselves.
Mark L. MoerdlerSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division · Senior Research Analyst
Beautiful. I'm going to change gear from the general to the more specific, probably the questions people are most interested in. Can you reiterate the implications of the Figma deal on your financials post close?
Scott K. BelskyAdobe Inc. · Chief Product Officer & Executive VP of Creative Cloud
Yes, sure. Well, I mean, first of all, what I would say about Figma, it was quite a process, certainly my first rodeo in terms of a deal of this size, just being a part of the deal team. David Wadhwani, my colleague, runs the business, obviously drove this deal in particular. But we -- it took us 5 months to get really intimate and comfortable with what makes Figma work their underlying business and where the road map is taking them. And so it wasn't a surprise to me that it took more than 5 minutes for the rest of the world to understand why we were so excited about this deal and its potential. It's a remarkable company. They're bootstrapped, or they were rather $0 in revenue for the first, I think, 6 years as they were really building an incredible product and then went from 0 to $400 million in ARR in like 4 years, something like that, incredible net revenue retention, just remarkable, continued growth and also really, really impressive gross margins.
So at the end of the day or once this acquisition closes, it will very much be a driver of top line for us, for sure. But again, like the margin profile is also pretty strong. And there's just so many low-hanging fruits for us with this deal both right away. And then, of course, there is a synergy model we're super excited about over the long term.
But just to start, this is a company who just turned on their enterprise business. It's relatively new. This is one of the strengths of Adobe and as an entrepreneur coming into Adobe and being awake to just world-class enterprise sales and knowing how to drive these enterprise-wide agreements and just go-to-market motions that Adobe is so great at and then looking at a business like Figma that is so new in that regard, but has a world-class product and something that is going to be extraordinarily relevant over the next few decades.
It's pretty exciting to me to just have some of those near-term unlocks that will certainly help us reach far more customers and will, of course, be great for our investors as well. And then we can think about some of the longer-term synergies as well. And if you look at every product experience that any company is building these days, a lot of them, the source of truth of that product experience is in Figma. This is where designers and developers meet. This is where copywriters jumped in. And this is the experience.
I mean more and more of our businesses are only as good as our digital experience that we're delivering on a daily basis and optimizing and all of those experiences have assets and those assets, whether they be video or innovations or illustrations or whatever those are, they are often made in our desktop products. And so to wire up all the assets that are used to make world-class experiences with the product design and development platform that so many companies are using. It's a really exciting set of possibilities.
Jonathan VaasAdobe Inc. · Vice President of Investor Relations
And Mark I'll just jump in and give a little bit of color on margin. What we said when we announced it in Q3 was from our baseline, non-GAAP operating margin, which is around 44%, 45% world-class levels. In the first year after closing, the margin would dip between 1% and 2%, started to come back in year 2 and be back to baseline by the end of year 3 and accretive to our non-GAAP EPS thereafter. It just shows you our own efficiency and the scale of which Adobe operates that we can do a deal at this level with such a small margin impact in the near term and then accretive thereafter so we're proud of that as well.
Mark L. MoerdlerSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division · Senior Research Analyst
So thank you, Jonathan. Scott, you talked about all the low-hanging fruit in the rest. Can I get a little color? I know you don't obviously -- can't give too much, but a little color around what the vision, what you can do with this?
Scott K. BelskyAdobe Inc. · Chief Product Officer & Executive VP of Creative Cloud
Well, some of the things we've shared and these are all -- it's hard to declare and you shouldn't declare anything before that the teams are 1 team, and we can work on what the future holds together. But just a couple of things, just -- we are drivers for our excitement across this entire deal to the finish line. One is this just exploding space, product design and development and the strong assertion that it's becoming one. The fact that if you look at Figma's customer base, over 50% of their users are not designers. They are developers, product managers, copywriters, executives. These are folks who want to be stakeholders of the digital experience of the company. And it's actually pretty wild that for most companies, the only real stakeholders of what the digital experience is are the designers.
And then they pass red lines over to the developers and go back with whatever ends up being put to deployment and matches what was designed in the first place. And so we see this as a big space. We see it as a space that's important for Adobe, imagine integrating some of the digital experience capabilities like how a website performs back to the source where the designers are developing the website. I think there is a connectivity there that is a great advantage for us and for our customers.
Certainly, the next is to make the future of creativity just more collaborative in general. I mean Figma has a world-class platform, where multiplayer design happens every day. That's a fundamentally different type of platform than what we have over the decades built for our flag ship products. But there is just a lot of excitement around reimaging some of our own segments on this new multiplayer platform that Figma brings to the table. And then the third 1 is just around productivity and creativity being the new productivity. And what we mean by that is you look at organizations over the previous decades, we deployed productivity tools to everyone, like the Excels and PowerPoints and Words of the world. And now as a lot of this work becomes automated or done with ChatGPT and all the other AI resources at our disposal our conviction is that creative -- or people will need to stand out through their creativity as opposed to their productivity. Even if you're an investment analyst, you want your incredible infographics to come through. You want presentations that go viral. You want to use design skills and you want to leverage social platforms to spread ideas. And with that, I think that the deployment of creative tools will be important. And Figma, of course, brings in a product called FigJam, which is a new workplace collaboration tool that's become very successful for them. We have an Adobe Express, which we think that fits very well in and we can build out our offering of deploying the masses, creativity for the rest of us, if you will, and that's a big focus for us going forward as well.
Mark L. MoerdlerSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division · Senior Research Analyst
Excellent. Following up on that, can you give us some more color on where Adobe is in its journey to the web platform? And a, how Figma fits in? And b, because there's questions from the audience, what happens if it doesn't happen that you close on Figma?
Scott K. BelskyAdobe Inc. · Chief Product Officer & Executive VP of Creative Cloud
Sure thing. Well, what I'll say about our flagships, Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, InDesign. These are all products that we firmly believe should be multisurface experiences. So there's no reason why you should have to download a desktop product which is, if you think about our funnel, if someone wants to do something in illustration or photography or video and they have to download a product. That takes minutes in some cases. And then when they have it on their machine, they have to open it and that's the first time experience they have to go through. And then when they land in the product, they need to be able to navigate how to use it. And on the desktop -- and a piece of software on the desktop, it's a lot more challenging to personalized experience for every type of new customer. Fast forward to a world in which we deliver Photoshop on the web, which we've already announced and is in public beta or Photoshop or Illustrator on the web, which is now in private beta. And there's no download friction. You land in the product the moment you click get started or someone shares the link with you.
So our products inherently become viral when they are on web versus simply only on desktop. And then when you land in the experience, you are able to have a personalized onboarding based on who you are. So if you say I'm a beginner or I'm an intermediate or advance, we could give you a completely different product experience based upon who you are. And a lot of this came from a deeper understanding of our funnel back to your DDOM question in the beginning, realizing just how many folks drop off in our funnel because of the complication of our products and the fact that we can't deliver them on the web and whatever else.
And so years ago, we started this effort of bringing our products to the cloud, not just Creative Cloud as a brand term, but actually delivering all of our products cloud native, if you will. And now we're at a point where you can create Cloud docs in Photoshop as of the default, you can pick them up on mobile or on web. You can share a link and invite someone in and they can just jump into the link. And we're seeing some surprisingly good data points that suggest that customers get a lot of value from our products on the web.
So that's who we are in that journey. I would say that our web apps are now public data, private data or coming. And we're learning how we can personalize these experiences to make them far more attractive for customers and for the business. And Figma is a bit of a different animal. Figma is a product design and development platform. It's -- they have multiplayer capabilities in a way that we frankly wouldn't be able to do and wouldn't really need to do on a Photoshop like products because customers don't want 50 people in their Photoshop file.
That would be a nightmare for that type of customer who's is in which editing and you're dealing with layers. But with a product experience that includes hundreds if not thousands of panels and pages and everything else, you actually do want tons of people in. So I think we've built the platform purpose built for that use case, which is why I think it's such a valuable addition to the franchise.
Mark L. MoerdlerSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division · Senior Research Analyst
So it adds capabilities in depth and breadth, but isn't necessary for your web journey or the core creative products.
Scott K. BelskyAdobe Inc. · Chief Product Officer & Executive VP of Creative Cloud
That's right.
Mark L. MoerdlerSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division · Senior Research Analyst
That's fair. Okay. Good. A number of questions. We put out a note in effect today about ChatGPT and, in fact, use ChatGPT to write. So note -- but a number of questions coming in for people and asking, can you speak to the competitive landscape may have changed for Adobe and maybe for Figma given the impact on creation and design productivity from generative AI.
Scott K. BelskyAdobe Inc. · Chief Product Officer & Executive VP of Creative Cloud
Yes. No, it's probably one of our hottest topics right now, and we have the a ton of work going on in this area. And let me explain to you quickly the framework that we use to apply to the row of generative AI throughout our products. We see every potential customer of ours and current customer on a spectrum of outcome-oriented creativity to process-oriented creativity. Outcome oriented creativity, the target product for them is Adobe Express. These are people who come in saying, I have an idea of what I want and I just need it now. So if you're -- if you're writing a blog post about a -- about robotics and medicine, and you want an image of a robot doctor. And you can just speed that into a generative AI model that prompt. I need a robot doctor, and whatever you get, you're pretty much happy with.
If it looks good, you don't really care if the robot doctor is standing a little to the left or to the right or is wearing a blue lab coat versus a white lab coat, you don't care. You just need to have an image. That's our prototypical outcome-oriented customer. And so they're template-driven. They'll use generative AI to get quick images of problems, and they don't need to have pixel precision and control over their output. Then you have the process-oriented creative that is quite the opposite. These are our customers who want control layer by layer of an asset. If they give that command, they're going to want to move the robot doctor a little bit to the left. They're going to want to make them a little shorter, a little taller. They're going to want to have control.
And so we have 2 sets of customers, if you will, that we have to really think through for the role of generative AI. And so fortunately, on the Adobe Express side, it's pretty clear we already demoed at MAX in October, our big conference. We showed how you can make any kind of fund you can imagine with a prompt. You can bring some of it in an image or complete an image using Adobe Express, and we have all of those capabilities launching this year on Adobe Express. And I can talk about some of the underlying models and the dynamic there in a minute.
And on the process-oriented side, whether it's Photoshop or Premiere Pro. First of all, we support third-party plug-ins already, any of which used some of the Stable Diffusion or open AI models that are out there. And then we also have our own homegrown models that are being purpose-built for what our customers really need. They need to bring in an object on a layer in Photoshop or completed out in the asset and image because it's missing a little bit. They have to fill out a format that's a little bit bigger than what they have. We have generative AI capabilities that are coming into our product that would just complete that for them.
Mark L. MoerdlerSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division · Senior Research Analyst
So you see it as augmenting what you have, not competing against what you have. Is that fair?
Scott K. BelskyAdobe Inc. · Chief Product Officer & Executive VP of Creative Cloud
Absolutely. I've never been a customer who would like to take an hour to do something that could be done in a minute or a second. And so we have to outfit our customers to be able to be as productive as humanly possible. And I also have seen through our customers' feedback to us that they need precision control, even if they prompt an algorithm to fit something out, they need to be able to take it further and in the immunology a lot of our customers use is generative AI is like a huge swath of interns that you can staff on something and explore something. But then at the end of the day, they bring back to you the proposals, the ideas, and then your job is to synthesize it, put it in a story, perfect it and then bring it to the clients. And I don't think that part will change.
Mark L. MoerdlerSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division · Senior Research Analyst
Beautiful. Changing gears, another question, a couple of them came in the same one from the audience is, to the extent you can answer it, Scott or Jonathan, that would be great. How are you evaluating the likelihood in path to regulatory approval for Figma? What's your sense of where this process is going. Obviously, you're not the lawyers, you can't talk about that, but what's the sense you are in terms of it? Because there's a lot of controversy out there as to what's happening from a regulatory point of view in the whole world with every acquisition?
Scott K. BelskyAdobe Inc. · Chief Product Officer & Executive VP of Creative Cloud
Yes. Jonathan, do you want to give the kind of the latest update that we have?
Jonathan VaasAdobe Inc. · Vice President of Investor Relations
Yes, sure. And some of these details were shared in the [ S-4 ] that we filed as well. We mentioned we are in a second request process with the Department of Justice, and that was expected. Like you mentioned, in this environment, frankly, in any environment, $20 billion acquisitions usually get a closer look. And so we're in regular dialogue and producing the documents as well as Figma is producing documents that they requested for, were in the process with the regulators in the U.K.
And we said we also expect the same in Europe. And so -- it's just a matter of getting them the information that they're looking for. And what we hear is the process has been very collegial and is progressing as expected. And we believe that the deal will be cleared and close later this year.
Mark L. MoerdlerSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division · Senior Research Analyst
Beautiful. Thank you. So changing gears, let's go -- let's maybe go back to the Creative Cloud itself. Can you give us some color on what the demand for creative tools look like today versus pre-COVID and during COVID? Have you reached the top of that S curve at this point?
Scott K. BelskyAdobe Inc. · Chief Product Officer & Executive VP of Creative Cloud
Well, the traffic patterns continue to be very strong. And I think that during COVID certainly saw some haywire in the system where certain things like video exploited and yet things like photography slipped because people weren't buying cameras to go travel anymore. And therefore, they didn't need the downstream products to support things like travel photography and that sort of thing. So it's nice to have that haywire out of the system and kind of be back to the macro trend, which is that creativity has never been more important.
People -- anyone on social platforms, they increasingly want to stand out. How do they stand out? They want to use creative capabilities that aren't natively available on the social platform that they're using. So whether it's a TikTok customer starting to use Adobe Express or even Premiere Pro or customers on Instagram using after effects to make really cool effects in the background.
One of the things I'm driving the product teams to do across non-Pro and Pro products is ensure that we are really natively supported the formats and the possibilities of the formats of the social products. We also have brought in scheduling to social platform. So Adobe Express, now whenever you're done with making an asset, you can choose instead of exporting it as an asset and uploading it yourself to Instagram or TikTok or whatever, you can actually schedule to post it, which is what we find is driving retention and better growth lifts for our products. And so the top of funnel wise, to me, there is no shortage of opportunity there. It's all about making sure that we own the nonbranded search terms that we want to compete in or make a lot of progress in having authority in those terms.
So we bring those customers in and make our products more collaborative so that people can share them with each other and bring in more customers that way. And then thinking about the new use cases of creativity. So I mentioned something like Infographics, social media posting, presentations. More people are using Adobe Express for presentations now. So we're exploring the relevance for that base and helping customers get into our products through that less friction.
Again, like some of the growth leverage for us are as simple as making sure that customers can start using Photoshop without even having to download Photoshop, back to our earlier conversation on web. So top of funnel is strong, and I still find quite a bit of low-hanging fruit in terms of our teams to better convert it.
Mark L. MoerdlerSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division · Senior Research Analyst
It's as strong as it was pre COVID?
Scott K. BelskyAdobe Inc. · Chief Product Officer & Executive VP of Creative Cloud
I think category-by-category, I think you'll see variances. There are certainly parts of it that are much stronger than we saw in terms of pre-COVID. And then there is some segments that have like fluctuated based on what COVID has brought or that sort of thing. I don't -- I can't really -- I don't know and exactly the numbers of traffic, apples-to-apples overall.
Mark L. MoerdlerSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division · Senior Research Analyst
Okay. That's fair. Can you explain the difference in what a communicator might need from the creative tool versus a professional or a consumer?
Scott K. BelskyAdobe Inc. · Chief Product Officer & Executive VP of Creative Cloud
Yes, sure. The communicator is very much that outcome oriented creative I was describing earlier. The communicator comes in wanting to do things very quickly. They care more about getting something fast that looks good than they do about the creative control or the process of getting there. And so that's really where a template-driven product like Adobe Express, generative AI capabilities, they'll either prompt something and just get a bunch of things to choose from. And also AI-driven assistance for someone to look better. The way I like to describe Express sometimes for this communicator customer you're describing, it is almost like having a marketing department in your pocket. What does the marketing department do? It keeps you on brand, they make sure you use the right logos and the right fund. It suggests templates based on the season, based on the holidays, whatever the case might be. It might even automatically generate some text for you based on your previous posts. It can suggest stock to you, and it always kind of has very rigid template so you don't have to go off and make something that looks bad. And it connects with your designers. So if you're actually a social media marketer or a communicator at a big company, what I love about the competitive advantage of using Express versus any of these other competitors out there is that it actually connects with the creative cloud libraries that the designers use.
And so if you're at any CPG brand or any other brand in the world that is an Adobe customer on the Creative Cloud side, and you have deployed Adobe Express to your social media marketers and other people throughout your organization.
Now they can actually work with the latest logo and the latest brand elements for the holiday and whatever the case might be, it all connects. And I think that's part of the message. As Adobe Express becomes a product ready for enterprise this year. That's one of the things we're excited about in 2023, that's a key value prop for us.
Mark L. MoerdlerSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division · Senior Research Analyst
So drilling a little bit on that. Specifically, what positions Adobe best to capture those communicators because it's a big part of your potential TAM versus the down market competitors such as Canva and things like that.
Scott K. BelskyAdobe Inc. · Chief Product Officer & Executive VP of Creative Cloud
Well, first of all, product, product, product. We have to have a product that is easy to use, that is powerful and that has some of that Adobe magic that no one else can bring to the table. And so the way we are actually building the next generation of the platform for Adobe Express that we talked about a little publicly is making sure that other teams around the company can easily contribute to it. So if there's some breakthrough in Photoshop or Premiere Pro, they can bring that in, in a very light and accessible way to Adobe Express for those customers to then be able to use.
But in a quick term, so letting -- meeting as really agile as a company, because we built it on a new platform that everyone can contribute to. So I'd say it starts product, for sure. On the go-to-market side, I'm really excited about the things that only Adobe can do. I look, for example, at how Microsoft used Teams to start to compete with Slack in market. And they use the kind of imprint of Office and the usage of their video conferencing tool to start to make inroads in their Team messaging tool, right? What's the analogy for us? I look at Document Cloud. Document Cloud reaches, gosh, hundreds and hundreds of millions of people, whether it's through our browser plug-ins or mobile apps or Acrobat installed on probably north of 1 billion machines. And those customers are what? They're communicators. They are those noncreative Pro customers that are doing things with documents.
Our thesis is that those people also want to look good. They also want to have a nice cover page for their PDF. They also want to have a beautiful Infographic that shows rather than tells the message and the story of the data. And so if you can bring Adobe's press capabilities through that channel, we can have a great advantage in market and in terms of growth. And so those are some of those really exciting unlocks that our team feels we are now poised to start tapping now that the product is getting to a point where, again, it's ready for enterprise, and it's on this new platform that we're launching this year will be more easily deployed elsewhere.
Mark L. MoerdlerSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division · Senior Research Analyst
How do you keep the Express product from eating into the Creative Cloud?
Scott K. BelskyAdobe Inc. · Chief Product Officer & Executive VP of Creative Cloud
Well, I actually think it would -- if anything, I might bet is that express will boost retention for Creative Cloud. And the reason I say that is we need a lot of customers who come in because they want Photoshop or they want Illustrator or they want Premiere Pro or whatever, but may actually not use it every day. They might use Photoshop once a week or 3 times a month or whatever the case may be. And it's actually a good number of customers that are in that zone where unless they get more value out of Creative Cloud, they could be at risk of churning.
And so how do we make sure that we help them find the discover leverage more value in Creative Cloud. Adobe Express is a perfect solution for that because Express allows them to do everything else without learning all the other tools of Creative Cloud.
So you have an Illustrator, you start using Express for video creations for social, where you have a Premiere Pro customer who is a YouTuber who's using Express to make their image thumbnails for YouTube. I mean these are all very popular examples of the cross utilization that we're seeing right now.
And so one of the big drivers this year that Shantanu is personally excited about, it reminds me every product checking we've got is how do we make sure that every Creative Cloud member discovers the value of Express, because we're seeing a positive correlation there, and we want to make sure that it's seen as value of Creative Cloud.
I also would say that a lot of customers come in being outcome oriented, the way I described that side of the spectrum. And then through a natural desire as humans to go a little deeper and get curious, they get a result and they're like, "Oh, I wish I could just do this. I wish I could just do that." And it's a thing that Express doesn't allow them to do. And so with the new version of our platform, you'll have a little button that says open in Photoshop, and open that asset in Photoshop on the web, and you can imagine that kicking off a trial for an upgrade to Creative Cloud.
And so I think that in some ways, Adobe Express will become a more finely tuned top of funnel for us that will better guide customers to products that ultimately yield more ARPU for Adobe.
Mark L. MoerdlerSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division · Senior Research Analyst
Makes sense. Can you comment at this point on the adoption trends you're seeing for Express?
Scott K. BelskyAdobe Inc. · Chief Product Officer & Executive VP of Creative Cloud
I think I always said publicly, I mean, this is a products where we're still in the zone of usage, usage, usage. And I'm really happy as a product leader that I have my executive team on the same page that we're not trying to drive these teams towards finding every little path towards conversion and aggressive pay walls. We are trying to demonstrate real value and usage.
Right now, the NPS is high. We are starting to win on a lot of the keywords. We set out to start to win on -- from nonbranded search terms like Make a Logo, things like that. And both the traffic now as well as revenue are growing at a fast clip. But again, like we're just in the early innings of this product. And I don't think for that reason, we haven't gone into too much depth yet on some of the underlying trends.
Mark L. MoerdlerSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division · Senior Research Analyst
So one of the questions from the audience. Can you give us some color of outside the U.S. because most of the time when we talk about Express and everything else, we're more focused on the U.S.? How is that going outside the U.S.? Is it similar in terms of Express?
Scott K. BelskyAdobe Inc. · Chief Product Officer & Executive VP of Creative Cloud
Yes. There are positive trends across all the geographies that Express is in market right now. We are focusing on a few top-tier markets because it's important for the product teams and the go-to-market teams to really like get the right gears going in a smaller number of markets, so we can just take the best practices playbook and scale it from that point. So we are still in that phase.
But -- and I don't have direct numbers for you as it relates to some of the other markets outside the U.S., but we are -- I know we're in dozens of languages, that sort of thing.
Mark L. MoerdlerSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division · Senior Research Analyst
Okay. There's concern that Express could get a similar fate as Spark. What do you say to that?
Scott K. BelskyAdobe Inc. · Chief Product Officer & Executive VP of Creative Cloud
I mean Spark was an experiment that only allowed template-driven graphic design. Express is a mixed media editor that allows video editing, image editing, illustration. It has multiples of not only the templates available but a full integration into stock. And it's -- we basically -- the only similarity is that we leverage the Spark platform, the underlying platform to get Express into market faster, while we were building the next generation Express platform, which is launching this year, which is what gives us the enterprise readiness, the connection to the rest of the Creative Cloud, et cetera.
And so we discontinued Spark when we launched Express because all of the functionalities are on graphic design, in particular, we're also in an Express given the fact that we leveraged that platform to build it. But it's curious to me when people kind of compare the 2. I mean it's just the product curious to me, but they're completely -- they're apples and oranges. And of course, Spark was something that we learned a lot from and applied to Express. But the degree to which the entire company is now aligned around Express, what it's going to be and how we're bringing it to market is just entirely different.
Mark L. MoerdlerSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division · Senior Research Analyst
Can you -- another question on Express from the audience. Can you explain why -- I mean we talk -- answer a little bit why it doesn't eat the Creative Cloud users. But who do you see as the specific user difference for Express versus Creative Cloud? Or is there not a difference?
Scott K. BelskyAdobe Inc. · Chief Product Officer & Executive VP of Creative Cloud
Yes. I really described the Express customer as the outcome-oriented customer. This is someone who knows exactly they have something in their mind that they want, and they just want it as quickly as possible. A lot of our customers come in through these nonbranded search terms like edit an image, edit a video, merge a video, make an Instagram flyer, make a TikTok. And these are folks who have those desires. It may be too much for them to learn Premiere Pro and after effects in order to make a TikTok, but they can come in and be successful very quickly with Adobe Express and then be in the ecosystem, discover all other things that they can be provision to -- and then in some cases, those folks become more pro like. They desire more creative control and they can upgrade into our more Pro products across Creative Cloud.
But the answer to your question is it is the communicator they want to stand out on social platforms or at work. The students who are being asked instead of writing a history paper and make a history video, make them a multimedia presentation. That seems to be the new thing in education these days, which is certainly a positive for us and our deployment of Express through that education and it's -- and these people have a quick action in mind.
Mark L. MoerdlerSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division · Senior Research Analyst
Last year, we heard from every investor was focused on the Metaverse and the varying opportunities. Are you still having these types of conversations with customers? How well you positioned in the Metaverse?
Scott K. BelskyAdobe Inc. · Chief Product Officer & Executive VP of Creative Cloud
Yes. Well, we're in the period of technology I love most, which is when the -- all the exclamations and the sort of overzealous stand fairs subsides and some of the core use cases that are so amazing prevail more clearly because of the removal of all the noise.
And so what are those things? Well, when I think about Metaverse, I really think of 2 things. I think of immersive experiences in the whole world of 3D, and then I also think about some of the decentralized blockchain type technologies as well. So let me speak quickly to both.
On the former, on immersive experiences, it's -- I can't tell you what devices will win and which experiences we will go into for our immersive moments of the future. But what I do know is that there is a here and now opportunity that a lot of our customers are realizing for 3D as it relates to building marketing collateral as well as just doing product R&D. Think about the old world where you would take a cane of a beverage or any other consumer product, you'd have to put it in sets in photo studios with different backgrounds to culturalize the asset in order for marketing campaigns across the world. And that was an extraordinarily labor-intensive and expensive thing.
And now a lot of our customers are realizing that they can render this object as opposed to shoot it. They can apply textures and materials using our substance 3D products. They can put it in a new product we launched, which is growing pretty fast and that space called Stager, which actually places the object, you can make a different background, a different table setting, a different everything.
And then you take synthetic photographs of that asset and you use that as your marketing collateral. And it's one of those rare better, faster, cheaper value props for our customers because once they kind of realize how this works, it's kind of a no-brainer and no going back. At least there's more creativity, it's obviously cheaper than photo shoots, that sort of thing.
Some of our customers, big footwear companies are now using this technology also for product R&D. Instead of waiting for a factory somewhere overseas to source the texture of material and make these samples and send them back they're rendering this stuff in days. They have it in front of potential customers to see what the feedback is. So that's like the here and now opportunity for immersive technology.
What these customers are doing by doing these workflows I just described is they're becoming Metaverse ready because now that they have these 3D assets in their inventory. And so whenever there's opportunities with Meta or some future device from who knows who makes it, right, they'll be able to deploy that asset. They already have it in their arsenal. They'll be able to start to play with it. You can add some behaviors to this can and port it into a new world that's launched by one of the companies exploring the Metaverse. So that's that side of it.
And so as a company, we're very pragmatic about this. We have a very fast-growing business within the Digital Media franchise, probably one of our highest growth businesses year-over-year for the 3 inversive space. And so we are hitting the ground running, getting every customer to realize this better, faster, cheaper opportunity now, especially e-commerce-driven companies, CPG companies, that sort of thing. On the -- just really quickly on the blockchain side. I'm also -- I still am excited about that technology. I think that the real relevance of NFTs for our customers will be making digital goods that can be portable across different digital experiences. When I talk to some of our luxury goods customers at Adobe, they talk to me about, we want to be able to sell a precious good in whether it's road blocks or whether it's decentralland or some of these other places. But customers won't pay a lot for it unless it's portable, unless they actually own it and they can follow them wherever they go. And the NFT technology could enable that. So that's where I think the -- it still has legs.
Mark L. MoerdlerSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division · Senior Research Analyst
Excellent. So let's flip there was a news article today talking about how many places the Adobe tools are being used in video. Can you give us a sense of how much in mainstream movies and things like that, the Adobe products are fitting in and where they're fitting in?
Scott K. BelskyAdobe Inc. · Chief Product Officer & Executive VP of Creative Cloud
Yes, sure thing. And actually, I remember my colleagues are at Sundance were at the last few days right now, and Adobe has a real presence there because a lot of the up-and-coming filmmakers are using all of our products and have a pretty vocal stakeholders and what's next for those products. I would say that the trend I'd like to see in Hollywood is that there are -- I would say the editors that in Hollywood that have been around for a very long time, maybe using Avid still, a lot of the next-generation editors, I find coming to Premiere Pro and [indiscernible]. I think part of that is because of the strength of our collaboration capabilities, especially enabled by the Frame acquisition. We've really integrated Frame into Premiere Pro, and so it's far easier now to share edits and get feedback from all sorts of stakeholders in real time without any friction. But the Hollywood space is actually quite a small space of the video business overall. Every company is now in video production. Every company needs to produce real-time content to connect with customers, even product leaders at Facebook and other places like that, doing weekly video series about their products. And so the widespread growth the video continues and Premiere Pro and our whole digital video and audio bundle is really in a great place for that, especially with the Frame acquisition.
Mark L. MoerdlerSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division · Senior Research Analyst
So maybe give us the 2 second quick update on frame.io.
Scott K. BelskyAdobe Inc. · Chief Product Officer & Executive VP of Creative Cloud
Sure thing. So the first year was really about some of the low-hanging fruit integrations that add value to customers, making sure that in Premiere Pro, when you click share you are prompted to just generate instantaneously an instance in frame.io and be able to get feedback, what was exciting to see about this acquisition was that there were so many customers who still did it the old way. I mean sending around a video and then waiting for timestamp, time-coded e-mail responses and then as a video editor reconciling 7 different people getting back to you, telling you don't know what to do at minute 3:42 versus 4:28. I mean it just -- it was extraordinarily noisy and the cognitive load unbearable for our editors.
And yet when people use frame.io, it all went away. And when we looked at the Premiere Pro base, you realize 90% plus of that base, was still doing it the old way. And so the low-hanging fruit for us is just getting people to discover this and use it. And so in fact, across the whole franchise, we have a share button now in all of our core products. Video, of course, share drives to frame.io. In our other products, it now brings people into a web supported workflow to get feedback as opposed to the PDF or exporting as a JPEG.
So I like to joke with my team that we're competing against the PDF, which is, I guess, an internal sense of competition. But it's -- we're trying to help these collaboration flows become more effective. If you look at Frame going forward, we are bringing all kinds of integrations like being able to see the timestamp feedback actually within the Premiere Pro interface, making it far easier to share with groups and making it a far better presentation of a video because you're sharing with all sorts of stakeholders. Customers who want more customization as it relates to that.
Mark L. MoerdlerSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division · Senior Research Analyst
So collaboration seems to flow through a lot of -- improving collaboration with a lot of what you're doing in next generation. It's part of the Figma. One of the questions here is, if some crazy reason, the Figma deal can't go through, can Adobe develop the same type of or sort of valuable enough collaborative technology in-house?
Scott K. BelskyAdobe Inc. · Chief Product Officer & Executive VP of Creative Cloud
In our collaboration journey, we are well along it right now, and we also have a major pickup of our collaboration tools already, whether it's Frame, whether it's share for review that we've now launched already in Photoshop and Illustrator. Obviously, the web expressions of those flagships are already entering market. I actually, just this morning spent time with the CIOs of one of the largest agency conglomerates in the world. And we were talking all about this notion of content velocity and how they're -- they have hundreds of agencies in their holding group that are dealing with insatiable demands amongst their customers for more content across more formats, with more personalization and more stakeholders being a part of that process, we had a full hour or 2 dialogue around our collaboration offerings and how to integrate. Essentially Workfront, I mean Workfront is also a collaboration tool that we acquired and now have integrated into the digital experience products and are also thinking about how it integrates with Frame and our Creative Cloud products. And so collaboration is just a native part of creativity these days, and that was the story. We didn't really talk at all about Figma yet, obviously, which is a collaboration on the product design and development space. But it's very clear to me that collaboration is across every segment of creativity and we've made tremendous inroads across all of them that we're claiming today.
Mark L. MoerdlerSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division · Senior Research Analyst
So going to, I guess, the heart of the question the audience is asking, you don't need Figma in order to be able to build the level of collaboration. Figma brings you a mix, I don't want to put words in your mouth, but Figma brings you into new markets.
Scott K. BelskyAdobe Inc. · Chief Product Officer & Executive VP of Creative Cloud
Figma brings us into the product design and development market, which is a new market for us. We don't have a market-leading product in that market at all. And it also helps to find connection points between the asset creation tools and all the assets people make with our tools and the digital experiences that people are prototyping and heading off to developers. And so of course, there are benefits to making the product and design and development space, more collaborative by connecting with some of our other products that would serve customers. Like that synergy value is one of the things we're most excited about.
Mark L. MoerdlerSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division · Senior Research Analyst
Excellent. Going back to one of the things we talked about quickly. We talked about GPT-3 and things like that. Do you see Microsoft adding that capability to or their image creation capability that OpenAI has created. Do you see that as competitive to what Adobe does or just adjacent?
Scott K. BelskyAdobe Inc. · Chief Product Officer & Executive VP of Creative Cloud
I think that, first of all, we have a great relationship with Microsoft. We're working on a number of integrations that are -- that bring, I would say, the best of both of our companies to the surface for our customers. And I have no doubt that, that will continue. I do think that there's a whole part of the world that looks for an image on Google Search and just drives that image over and uses it. Are they allowed to use it? Is it the right images? Is it the best image? I mean, those sorts of things they just happened. I'm sure that many corporate PowerPoint presentations have all sorts of images in them from unauthorized sources.
We're focused on some people that use creativity for commercial creative production. People who need counter up images or templates that they are authorized to use, people that need to buy stock they're authorized to use and also on the Pro products, people that want to have control and precision over the quality of our outcome, that sort of thing.
And if anything, I think that space grows as people become more creatively inclined when you get a PowerPoint presentation that comes with an image in the template, you might actually be more inclined to find the right image for you because you see images in front of you. You're like, "Oh, I want to make more images. And so the way I sort of generalize my take on all this is as we make the world more creatively confident, with tools like Dolly-3 and integrated into various places or all these generative AI tools.
As you make people feel more confident creatively, then people are going to want to use creative tools to stand out more. And it's pretty sad actually, that our key creative confidence for most of us is in kindergarten when we drew and showed things to our parents and teachers and they nodded gracefully. And then it kind of went down from there as you realized that we weren't all that good and we didn't have the skills. So creative confidence going up is good for Adobe and good for the world.
Mark L. MoerdlerSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division · Senior Research Analyst
So changing gears, another question from the audience. The Creative Cloud is an amazing brand with some very functionality. Why has Adobe been sort of slow, not to raise pricing there? Was it looks like it's only been, as they say, a 10% increase in over a long period of time?
Scott K. BelskyAdobe Inc. · Chief Product Officer & Executive VP of Creative Cloud
Well, I think that we've just seen great demand for our products. And part of our mission -- in fact, the literal mission of Creative Cloud is creativity for all. And so we want to make sure that fulfill that mission by making our products more accessible. Now we also have become much better at upgrading customers and also we call it internally fries with that, the notion of upselling additional packages. So think about Stock is an add-on. The [ 3 ] universe package is an add-on to Creative Cloud all apps. .
So as we get customers into our funnel, we are quite confident that we have an opportunity to drive ARPU through these add-ons and enhancements and that sort of thing. And so if you forecast into the future, what are some of the new most exciting technologies, generative AI, additional capabilities with the immersive staff being able to better track analytics for your assets as you deploy them. I mean there's all sorts of things that I think we can extract value from by adding the value to our customers, and that's been the playbook.
Mark L. MoerdlerSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division · Senior Research Analyst
So you're figuring that those -- the ones you just mentioned plus others are more likely to be an upsell or with fries type of approach rather than bundled in and increase the general price?
Scott K. BelskyAdobe Inc. · Chief Product Officer & Executive VP of Creative Cloud
That will be a much more mission-consistent approach to growing our business, and it's a very -- it's one that's working. It's really healthy. And my goal is to get hundreds of millions if not billions of people that are using Adobe products for their creativity.
And with that, I'm pretty confident that we will have people wanted to upgrade the teams. We'll have enterprises deploy creative tools for a -- more broadly, they will start using our iImmersive and 3D creation products and Adobe Express and Stock and all those sorts of things in generative AI capabilities that might be add-ons as well.
Mark L. MoerdlerSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division · Senior Research Analyst
So following that, do you really think the TAM for creative is in the hundreds of millions or billions of users based on what you have today? Or is there still lots of work to get there?
Scott K. BelskyAdobe Inc. · Chief Product Officer & Executive VP of Creative Cloud
Well, any single person that expresses themselves on social platforms is seeking to do so accretively. No one want us to not stand out. Let's just put it that way. Like everyone wants great content, otherwise, unless you're copying and pasting someone else's content, I suppose some folks do that.
But that's -- I look at this and I say, "Gosh, if people -- if creativity is truly the new productivity, given all these algorithms and generative AI capabilities, everything else that's replacing human labor in so many instances, we have to outfit creative to do what only humans can do, which is to be creative. And we believe that, that should integrate into any place where they want to express themselves.
So whenever you're making a PDF, you should have a cover page, you should have better graphs, beautiful things to post on social platforms, et cetera. So if you look at the world through that lens, which we firmly do because we see the data, we see people starting to flirt with making something for their business on Instagram and before you know it, they're producing video. So with that thesis, absolutely.
Mark L. MoerdlerSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division · Senior Research Analyst
Excellent. Last minute or 2 we have left, what do you think the world both from an end-user point of view and from an investor point of view, maybe missing about the opportunity and the positioning of Creative Cloud.
Scott K. BelskyAdobe Inc. · Chief Product Officer & Executive VP of Creative Cloud
Well, I think that these are -- it's probably things that we know can be tackled to the benefit of customers into the business that we haven't fully exploited yet. I mentioned a few just in this conversation, leveraging Document Cloud as a channel that we can use to bring Adobe Express and some of our more accessible creative capabilities to everyone. And certainly, the web. And the web is an inherently more viral platform that's more collaborative. The breakthrough of us bringing Photoshop to the Cloud to enable mobile and web extensions of that flagship. That's profound.
I mean Photoshop is, of course, an amazing brand for us, and we have a lot of unlocks, in my view, forward for that funnel as a result of that breakthrough. Have we proven that through the business yet? No. And we're in early days. We are in early days and our flagships being available on the web. We're in early days of every creative sharing with 2.3 stakeholders through a share button and what that could actually mean for individuals to become teams, Creative Cloud Team accounts or for CC Team accounts to become enterprise accounts.
There are some of these early days opportunities that -- and you're talking to the product guy here. So this is always my bias. But this is the healthy tension, I think, whereas my colleague, David, who drives the business, there's a lot of like near-term quarter-over-quarter things we can do to continue to drive business for Adobe, as you know it today.
I am, of course, excited about those things, but also even more excited about some of these unlocks as you make these platform shifts because those are the lead products that really drive growth in the business, as we all know, and we're in full throttle on those right now, which is great. It's been years in the making to deliver on the promise of Creative Cloud truly in the cloud.
Mark L. MoerdlerSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division · Senior Research Analyst
Excellent. I really do appreciate it. Thank you very much, Scott, Jonathan. Scott, the depth and breadth of the knowledge is obvious there, and we appreciate you sharing what you can in terms of a lot of this and futures, et cetera. And looking forward to some great new products and capabilities relatively quickly.
Scott K. BelskyAdobe Inc. · Chief Product Officer & Executive VP of Creative Cloud
It sounds like a plan, Mark. Thank you.
Mark L. MoerdlerSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division · Senior Research Analyst
Thank you so much. All the best.
Scott K. BelskyAdobe Inc. · Chief Product Officer & Executive VP of Creative Cloud
Bye-bye.
