Prepared Remarks
William Verity PowerRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division · Senior Research Analyst
All right. Good afternoon. We're going to go ahead and get started. Thanks, everybody, for being here. I'm Will Power. I cover cloud software for Baird. It's my pleasure to welcome Dynatrace, a leader in observability. From the company, we have Jim Benson, who is the Chief Financial Officer. So Jim, thanks so much for being here.
I guess this is going to be a fireside chat format. And if you have questions in the audience, you have some instructions in front of you. That's a great way to just submit any questions you might have, and I'll try to get those included as well. And maybe just to kind of kick it off, for those that might be not familiar with the story, maybe just a little bit of background on the company and kind of your kind of core target markets, maybe differentiators.

Question and Answer
James Martin BensonDynatrace, Inc. · Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer
Sure, sure. Well, first, I want to thank actually having even some audience out here for a 5:00 on the first day of the conference. So you guys are troopers.
So just a brief overview of Dynatrace. So we talk as a company about like what is the vision of what we do. And the vision of what we do is we really want a world where software works perfectly. And I think you say, well, what exactly does that mean? I think we all know in our day-to-day interactions with different applications that software doesn't always work perfectly. And in the world today, with IT environments that are either on-prem, they're in public clouds, they're in hybrid clouds. They're in very multi-cloud environments that the need to identify with precision when there's problems with software is becoming critical.
So the need to identify which software issues exist and then a need to figure out how do you go remediate them. So at its simplest level, what Dynatrace does is we are a leader in the observability space, which provides infrastructure software to identify and remediate issues. And what makes Dynatrace unique is we are -- we've been purpose-built as a platform for enterprise-oriented customers. And so there is a built-in level of contextual analytics, there is a built-in level of AI and there's a built-in level of automation in the platform.
And in large enterprises, you can't have people chasing alerts. And the historical way of observability software companies to work is they have dashboards. And think of dashboards as green, yellow, red, flashing lights, people looking at them, and then people are going and identifying and figuring out where exactly is the issue and how do we remediate. What Dynatrace does is we have a built-in level within the platform to specifically identify the root cause of the issue and then a built-in level of automation to go address the issue.
So the company has been around for some time. We've been public now, I think, for 5 years. And the world is just getting more and more complicated, Will, as you know, that more and more workloads are moving into public cloud environments and with that becomes an explosion of data. And the more data, the more workloads, the more complexity, the more need for observability software. So it's a very rapidly growing market, and we think we are poised to benefit with the evolution of the market.
William Verity PowerRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division · Senior Research Analyst
Yes. Okay. That's great. Let me start kind of higher level from a macro standpoint. I know you've had some comments and maybe you can update us as to what you're seeing in terms of larger customer activity and sales cycles and whatnot. But I know they've been more data points for the last couple of weeks even from some of the other software providers around macro maybe being a little bit worse. Just maybe a kind of real-time update as to kind of what you're seeing from macro, whether it's sales cycles, willingness to spend on new projects.
James Martin BensonDynatrace, Inc. · Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer
Yes. I mean I would say, not to say that we were kind of a bellwether, but we have been talking about kind of a choppy macro environment for some time, Will. That's why we'd say in the last couple of weeks, I don't think the environment has notably changed. It's still a kind of a choppy environment. That doesn't mean that it's worsening. So I personally don't think that it's necessarily worsening. We haven't seen that. We haven't seen that with deals.
Having said that, a choppy macro environment means customers are very budget sensitive. They are certainly prioritizing spend for observability. So -- but it's not unlimited spend. But I'd say the macro environment hasn't changed fundamentally. I've certainly listened as you have with others. I think what we identified maybe earlier, probably 6 months ago is a need to ensure you're building that into your ongoing expectations for your business that an ongoing choppy macro means deal cycles will tend to be elongated.
In our case, they were a little bit more elongated in our fourth quarter because we had some very, very large deals. So size of the deal, complexity of the deal go hand-in-hand and timing. The good news is we had a really strong fourth quarter and closed most of them. But I'd say the macro environment is pretty consistent.
William Verity PowerRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division · Senior Research Analyst
So maybe talk a little bit about what you're seeing upfront. I know you've got more of an enterprise focus, you've got good partner relationships with systems integrators that probably help on that front as well. What's kind of built into your expectations on that front for the year? And I think -- and I guess the second part of that is just trying to understand the level of conservatism, I guess, kind of the guidance from here? You've given some of that choppiness.
James Martin BensonDynatrace, Inc. · Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer
Yes. So we -- what we outlined, we are -- our fiscal year ends in March. So we guided for our fiscal '25 just 3 weeks ago. We talked about 3 things that we factored into our guide. One is we factored in to the discussion we just had an expectation for continued ongoing macro uncertainty. Two, what we included in the guide was what we think is going to be a growing trend of our observability architecture platform decisions. So customers that are interested in consolidating vendors.
And with that, we know from experience that, that tends to be larger deal sizes, and there tends to be deals that require C-level approvals, they take longer. And so we introduced into our guide some timing conservatism into that, knowing that you're not going to have a quarter just like we had in our last quarter where you run the table on all the deals, you're going to have choppiness potentially with that. So that's the second thing.
The third thing that maybe we'll talk about a little bit further here is we introduced some go-to-market changes for the company, not revolutionary changes, kind of evolutionary changes where we are -- we've looked at the segmentation of our customers, and we've reweighted some of our sales force to, I'll call them, higher propensity to spend customers. And whenever you make changes in your go-to-market segmentation even if they're evolutionary, the sales organization does take a time to kind of stabilize and mature.
And so those 3 things were built into the guidance. And so I feel reasonably confident that the guide we provided for our fiscal '25 factors those 3 things and that we tried to set an expectation that those things aren't going to change, Will, fundamentally in the next 3 months. So we'll probably be updating, call it, the top line guide more likely at midyear.
William Verity PowerRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division · Senior Research Analyst
Yes. I mean, the go-to-market changes are still new. How long do you think is it going to take to determine whether that has any kind of more meaningful impact, I guess?
James Martin BensonDynatrace, Inc. · Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer
Yes. I mean certainly, the benefit of these go-to-market changes are intended to drive more customer intimacy and to get better penetration within customers for which at the end of the day, should lead to more NRR for existing customers and hopefully, a better new logo penetration for some of these very large customers. And again, we haven't changed the profile of customers we're going after. We've always targeted what we call the Global 15000, which are the largest 15,000 enterprises out there.
But when we look at where the resources were being deployed, the sales resources that -- the top of that pyramid, Will, is -- of the Global 500, I'll call them, has greater than 50% of the spend, like the TAM. And so when we looked at how we were resourced in that segment of customers -- and oh, by the way, I talked about we are purpose built for the enterprise. Well, we're even more purpose built for very large, large enterprises.
And so we looked at the weighting of resources in that segment. And we, on average, had 8 to 10 accounts per rep and we thought we needed more weighting. And so we've actually changed from 8 to 10 accounts per rep for those Global 500 to 4 to 5. So you can do the math that we basically doubled the capacity of resources. And we're doing that because we think we can drive better penetration with existing customers and go after customers that maybe we're not as deep with -- because the sales motion is a little bit different with those customer segments that it is very much an account management oriented model where you're developing account plans.
You're much more embedded with the customer understanding what their strategy is and trying to understand how your solutions map to that. And so this drives more intimacy. And so the intention for these changes is to drive an improvement in rep productivity. But you're right, it will take some time, Will, for that to manifest itself. Probably we'll start to see it through pipeline generation and hopefully, in the back half of the year, we will start to see it in incremental productivity to the sales force.
William Verity PowerRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division · Senior Research Analyst
So let me ask you kind of -- if you take a medium-term view, I know you haven't given official guidance, but if you look 2 or 3 years out, how do you think about the growth rate of the business , right? You're effectively going to be mid-teens this year. What are the things that could help you get back to close to or to 20%. Is that still kind of the goal?
James Martin BensonDynatrace, Inc. · Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer
So I would say the answer is yes. I think that is -- one, I think that is it is our ambition for we ended fiscal '24 20% growth. I do believe that the capabilities of Dynatrace and of the platform, and of the evolution of where the market is going, I think you're seeing a growing interest in platform consolidation decisions. There is a growing need for observability as more and more workloads move into these complex environments.
And so I think the market supports us being able to get back to 20% ARR growth. Obviously, our guide this year is prudent. And we -- I told you the 3 reasons why. You can expect our internal plan is more ambitious than that, Will. But I think the market and our capabilities allow for an ambition to get back to 20%. Obviously, we have to execute against that Step 1 is stabilized ARR growth before you start talking about acceleration.
But all these go-to-market changes that we identified are designed to get deeper penetration, which means better execution out of the sales force. We're going to add incremental capacity as well. So I think there is certainly a path to get back. But I'd say, you mentioned 2 to 3 years. That's our ambition and I think we'll have to see. I think it's more of a -- I do not believe we are opportunity constrained. I think it's -- we're going to be, I'll call it, execution oriented.
William Verity PowerRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division · Senior Research Analyst
Yes. Okay. Well, it feels like one of the tailwinds is your DPS initiative, right, Dynatrace Platform Subscription pushing that. I think you talked about 700 customers now on some sort of DPS plan?
James Martin BensonDynatrace, Inc. · Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer
We have almost 20% of our customer base is on a DPS contract.
William Verity PowerRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division · Senior Research Analyst
So how impactful has that been thus far? I mean, early with some of those customers, but how much of a tailwind or opportunity could that be as that gets into deeper penetration of the base? Because I mean that would impact your NRR numbers, which should be...
James Martin BensonDynatrace, Inc. · Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer
So I'd say we're very pleased with 20% of our customers are now leveraging this. And just to be clear, it's not a -- this is not a forced march. This is not a requirement. So this isn't -- there's no special sales incentives. There's no customer being forced to move to this vehicle. But we believe it is a better vehicle for customers because it provides much better frictionless experience and a much better access to the platform with very transparent flexible pricing. And so it's roughly 20% of our customers, call it, a little over 30% of our ARR.
As you said, we've only been at it for a year. So the way to think about it is let's look at the cohorts that are actually on these vehicles. And what we are seeing is that customers that are on this DPS vehicle are consuming much more of the platform than non-DPS customers. And to your point, what that should lead to is earlier expansions. Earlier expansion should lead to more NRR. Now because you're -- we're really only on our first cohort class, which was Q1 and that cohort class is relatively small, I think where you're going to see the manifestation for that if we continue to see the traction we are is in the back half of the year.
William Verity PowerRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division · Senior Research Analyst
Yes. Are there key new products that customers are gravitating to trying to maybe they hadn't tried in the past? I mean -- and I guess maybe kind of guess to security and logs and some of your newer areas of focus, is that starting to open up doors?
James Martin BensonDynatrace, Inc. · Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer
I would say yes. It certainly opens up doors for them to try products that they haven't bought already. And it's just a much easier vehicle for them because historically, what they've done is they bought SKUs and they bought a finite number of host units for Application Performance Monitoring or Infrastructure Monitoring or Digital Experience Monitoring. And you didn't really have the flexibility to swap. So if, in fact, you were buying a finite number for each one of those things. What DPS allowed you to do is get access to everything with a rate card. So to your point, they can try things. And we have a customer success team that can introduce some of these things to them.
So we do believe it will -- and we've actually seen it, Will, that we -- the customers that are on a DPS contract leverage more of Dynatrace's capabilities than customers that are not on a DPS contract. Having said that, I'm intellectually honest that, that cohort tends to be your larger customers. And so by definition, they probably would have leveraged those solutions as well. But even when we break it down a little bit further, even customers that are new to Dynatrace that 70% of our new logos are on a Dynatrace platform subscription in Q4. We are seeing that those customers are leveraging more of Dynatrace's capabilities in their non-DPS counterparts.
William Verity PowerRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division · Senior Research Analyst
Why not incent sales to push that more? Wouldn't that be a...
James Martin BensonDynatrace, Inc. · Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer
Because we don't want it to be forced. We don't -- we want it to be customer choice. It has to be something that the customer is interested in. And so sometimes when you incent the sales force there, they will go to great lengths to sell something to a customer that maybe they're not interested in. I think over time, what you're better off doing is having a model that is incenting why would the customer want to buy DPS. Well, they want to buy DPS because it gives them all the things that I mentioned.
But there are some customers that maybe that is not -- that they are content with a SKU-based model, where they want a finite list of what they're going to purchase, and they maybe don't want to have a risk that they're going to exceed the budgeted allotment that they have. And the benefit of DPS for us is that the more they like it, the more they consume, the more they consume potentially means an earlier expansion. Well, from a customer's perspective, that might mean that they have a budget overage.
So we kind of have the benefits for us with -- we have a subscription model wrapped in a consumption drawdown. So I would say that I would rather have success with the model, drive what sales wants to do then force them.
William Verity PowerRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division · Senior Research Analyst
Yes. Okay. I've got a bunch of other questions, but I've actually got one here from the audience. So I'll go ahead just -- and throw it at you. Just the question is, what is the key differences in product or go-to-market compared to Datadog?
James Martin BensonDynatrace, Inc. · Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer
What is the key difference in what?
William Verity PowerRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division · Senior Research Analyst
The key differences in product and go-to-market compared to Datadog.
James Martin BensonDynatrace, Inc. · Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer
So I would say the product, I'd say at the highest level, there are similar products where you are performing a similar value proposition, whether it be application performance monitoring, infrastructure monitoring. So the products as they're outlined are similar. I'd say what's different is that the -- our embedded products have a level of contextual analytics. And so think of that as we have a very strong understanding of a customer's environment and their ecosystem and can identify very precisely where issues are and we can automate and instrument remediation for them.
I'd say relative to competitors, competitors have a more sophisticated dashboard oriented model, where you are leading it to humans to go identify -- there's going to be an alert that comes up, but humans are going to go chase the alert. And so I'd say what makes us -- the products and name are similar. I'd say the functionality that we provide is a bit more analytics, AI and automation than our competitors. And the go-to-market is different in that our go-to-market model is kind of an enterprise sales model.
That I'd say competitors like a Datadog, they do have an enterprise sales motion, but they also have a very strong motion with the hyperscalers where they're -- they kind of will go through a department sale through a hyperscaler that maybe they've added a workload into a hyperscaler and they want to add observability. So our model is very much an enterprise sales motion where we're selling primarily to the centralized IT decision maker. In some cases, they might be selling to the developer community.
William Verity PowerRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division · Senior Research Analyst
Yes. You bring up a good point because one of the key areas of differentiation for you all for some time. It's been Davis AI and innovations you've had there, just the level of automation that you help inject in organizations. Maybe just talk about the usage of automation, how important that is, to what degree you think that does help set you apart, I guess?
James Martin BensonDynatrace, Inc. · Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer
I think it's critical. And again, it varies based on persona, right? So we've targeted the largest enterprises in the world because our product is designed with them in mind, that large organizations have explosions of data, massive complexity and they're dealing with these very multi-cloud environments that are traversing from kind of mobile to mainframe with just an enormous amount of data and complexity.
And what Davis AI and some of the other capabilities that automation built in is it's just too much for a human to go chase. And so you have to have a level of built-in analytics and automation to actually allow them to do their job more effectively and more seamlessly. And so it works, I'd say it's resonating with customers. I think a proof point, Will, is as we've seen over the last quarter, an emerging trend of customers that are now considering consolidation decisions.
And one example is we had a land in our fourth quarter our largest land ever, a nearly 8-figure new logo land with a global airline that displaced 4 existing tools. And that -- it took a year. This deal took a year in the making. And it certainly started out with the customers saying, well, I don't want another tool. And then it morphed into, well, wait a minute, you mean you're actually -- your platform can actually solve some of the problems I have, which is I have a disparate set of tools. I have a poor experience for my customer, which is when there's an outage, I don't exactly know where the problem because it takes a long time to detect and it takes a long time to remediate. Prove to me that you can do something different from Dynatrace.
And after a sequence of months convert POCs. Again, this is -- we were not even in the customer's environment. So I think it is a proof point that we are different. And I'd say that our sweet spot is very large complex environments, and that's where we shine and that's what we go after.
William Verity PowerRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division · Senior Research Analyst
Yes. Maybe just touch on then what kind of impacts you might be seeing on the kind of the generative AI from. Where is the opportunity for you all, a, to kind of enhance some of these automation capabilities? And b, from your lens, are you starting to see organizations actively try to get their data into the cloud, which would present an opportunity to help observe that data? Or is that still...
James Martin BensonDynatrace, Inc. · Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer
I would say certainly just as a level set that -- so we've been at AI for over a decade, right? We've had causal and predictive AI, causal being we can tell you the root cause of where the problem is not through correlations, but literally through topology of knowing exactly where the problem is. And we've had predictive AI for a decade, which is understanding different attributes that exist in an ecosystem to know when you potentially are going to have an outage. And so the benefit of those 2 things is you're going to identify issues quickly and you can prevent issues from happening in the first place.
But GenAI has allowed is you can now leverage large language models to be able to have not super users, be the ones that can figure out how to use all these analytics. You literally can have large language models that you can increase the number of practitioners that are leveraging the data source. And we call it hyper modal because you're going to be able to use GenAI, leverage with our causal on predictive AI going back and forth to be able to get better answers.
So I'd say we're still early days on the AI activity. I do think it's going to become more and more important as the observability ecosystem expands that the need for AI and identifying where issues are and automating them to your point and getting to the point where there's more automation and remediation going on as opposed to timing to detect and then effectively having people chase alerts to go figure it out. So you're talking going from maybe hours and days to kind of minutes. And that's what customers are expecting. And that's what, at the end of the day, the end user expects.
William Verity PowerRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division · Senior Research Analyst
Yes. Look, 2 of your new big opportunities are in application security, looking for, I don't know, abnormalities or different -- just given the lens you have across an organization, and then logs, right? I think you've called out you expect both of those to be $100 million business. You pushed that back a little bit this last quarter in terms of what you expect to get there. But what are you kind of seeing on those fronts? And can those be $0.5 billion businesses 5 years or 10 years or whatever from now? I mean because it seems like -- I mean some of your competitors, at least one in particular, has -- that's probably a big part of the platform, broader platform?
James Martin BensonDynatrace, Inc. · Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer
Yes. I mean I would say that the answer, the short answer is yes, that we still are very optimistic about -- we're very optimist about the core business. So I'll start out with those are emerging product areas that we've added with application security and logs. I'd say there's still a lot of runway, Will, with just the core business. And I think sometimes people forget that the core business still has a lot of runway.
Having said that, I do think that logs and application security, both should -- the first objective is to get them to be $100 million annualized businesses. I think those businesses can be significantly bigger than that. I do think our appetite in the application security space is going to have to broaden for that business to be materially larger that -- and we have an aspiration to go into areas like CloudSeam and things of that nature. So there will be more to say about what we want to do in the application security space here in the future. But I think both spaces are ripe for them being very, very large businesses for the company.
William Verity PowerRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division · Senior Research Analyst
So where do M&A then play in all that, right? You've got -- you generate your cash flow, get a balance sheet, how do you think about organic development versus M&A? What does that environment look like?
James Martin BensonDynatrace, Inc. · Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer
So one of the things that's made Dynatrace, I'd say, unique is that we -- others talk about having a unified platform in name either at a -- but it's really at a user interface level. Our platform is truly unified at the data layer. And so by definition, that platform means that acquisitions can't be bolt-ons, that you literally have to have acquisitions that you can embed into the platform. But that's -- that's the secret sauce of the company.
And so historically, what we've done, Will, is acquisitions have been much more technology tuck-in oriented. And so I think you're going to continue to see us do that. Could there be an adjacency in an area? I'm not suggesting that they couldn't. But I'd say it would have to make sense and leverage the power of the platform. And so I think that, that's what we will continue to do on the M&A front.
You're right, we generate a lot of free cash flow. We have a lot of cash on the balance sheet. We did announce a buyback, an opportunistic buyback program, which was another use of capital. We generate $400 million of free cash flow. We have $900 million worth of cash. The M&A aspirations that I just outlined are likely going to be probably more modest. And by the way, we did need to access the debt markets that we could given our profile.
And so we think we're in a good place. I think the first and foremost, we want to invest in the business. That is the priority but we thought a buyback actually made sense opportunistically to return cash to shareholders just given our financial wherewithal to do so.
William Verity PowerRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division · Senior Research Analyst
Yes. Okay. We do have another question here just around vendor consolidation. If you were to look at the top 200 accounts, is there an estimate of how many observability tools they might have on average and would you typically replace all the tools at once as a process?
James Martin BensonDynatrace, Inc. · Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer
Yes, it's a good question. I'd say every environment differs, but probably on average -- and they're not always all vendor-specific tools. They could be DIY tools that they've developed on their own. But I'd say of the deals that we've seen, customers may have between 5 and 7 solutions that they're using.
William Verity PowerRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division · Senior Research Analyst
Okay. Let me ask you just kind of in that vein. We're down to like kind of the last minute here, but a lot of questions on Cisco, Splunk, is that creating opportunities? I mean, obviously, you're still pretty early in logs. So I don't know if you have all the full capabilities you need to play there, but curious if that's how you're thinking about as an opportunity?
James Martin BensonDynatrace, Inc. · Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer
Yes. I mean, I would say anytime there's an acquisition, there is a level of uncertainty. Obviously, Cisco is you're going to endeavor to try to integrate the offerings that they have to have kind of the vision of what they're talking about become a reality. It hasn't materially changed customer conversations, customers that were interested in they've been interested in some cases for maybe alternative vendors for logs anyway.
So whether Splunk, Cisco, or whether it's plunk alone that I think we just felt that our opportunity. Our approach to log management analytics was a little bit different and that we thought we had a unique way of being able to address that. I'd say we're still early days at it. And we have roughly 600 customers leveraging our solutions. But I'd say aside from Cisco, I still think we have a lot of runway to make in the log space.
William Verity PowerRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division · Senior Research Analyst
Okay. Awesome. Okay. Well, with that, we're out of time. So please join me in thanking Jim for his comments.
James Martin BensonDynatrace, Inc. · Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer
Thank you.
