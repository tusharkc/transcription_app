Prepared Remarks
Ittai KidronOppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division · Managing Director
Okay. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Oppenheimer Tech Conference. This is our first day. And my name Ittai Kidron. I'm a technology analyst at Oppenheimer. And with us today is Datadog, Olivier, the CEO; and Yuka, IR, watching over, making sure everything is okay.
Olivier, thank you very much, and Yuka. Thank you both of you for joining us today for the session. We will do a little bit of a fireside chat here, conversation. But then, of course, we like the audience to get involved as well. You have a Q&A opportunity there on your screens that you can use.
And also, for those that know me, you can e-mail me the questions. I'll be watching -- I'll be multitasking here and watching the e-mail at the same time. And as questions come in, I'll try to work them into the discussion.
So guys, thanks again for joining us today. I really appreciate your attendance.
Olivier, I followed you for many, many years, and it's been quite impressive to see the evolution of the company. Maybe you could talk about quickly the evolution of the company, how you've expanded into observability, more recently, DevSecOps, cybersecurity. Help me think about the evolution over time. And also, how do you think about the gaps in your portfolio and the direction of the company going forward?

Question and Answer
Olivier PomelDatadog, Inc. · Co-Founder, CEO & Director
Sure. Yes. And first, thanks for having me today. So when we -- when I started the company with my cofounder, Alexis, we didn't actually set out to -- or set out to build a better mousetrap. We didn't say, hey, we [ sell ] a better customer monitoring product or -- we set out really to be able to have a platform that would be as broad as possible. It brings all the teams on the same page, like the teams -- those teams can actually share the same understanding or the same reality and work together towards that. So we started building this data platform.
And then we just have the first use case for it, which was cloud infrastructure monitoring. And we stuck to that use case for many years because there was a ton of traction for it, obviously. The whole market started building from legacy IT to cloud environment, and it gave us a really good way to enter inside of customers' environment.
But really, we always wanted to expand past that. And as soon as we could, we started branching into the other parts of the broader observability, particularly which were APMs or application performance management and log management.
And in 2019 is when we actually saw good traction for APM and log management. And that really was, for us, the point where we decided to take the company public. It was the proof point that we could grow beyond a single product company, that the platform vision and the data platform vision could actually come true, and that we could deliver growth for many, many, many years as we kept adding use cases, having new personas and rolling out different historical categories into our platform.
So obviously, we've kept adding to the observability suite, and we've added either experience monitoring, even waves. We've added network monitoring. We added database monitoring. There's a number of things that we've added in there that we sell part of the broader observability category.
We also started entering new categories that were quite separate, but which we think, in the end, target the same users or the same systems with different users and belong in the same place. So that's the case, for example, of security. We think security is not a sole problem, security monitoring, security automation in general. And we think that the way it's been approached to that by security specialized vendors is just not going to work. So we think we can have something to bring there that is very unique, and that we can solve that problem in interesting ways.
So we added security. We started entering more into developer workflows with obviously [ ICDs ], observability products. We see many more applications to what we do in ITSM workflows, in real-time BI, which is categories that we don't have really product SKUs to [ die for ], but we think are very relative to our platform.
So we see plenty of paths for expansion. And we want to keep doing what we've been doing so far, which is use of very large surface of contact with our customers to expand and solve a bigger problem for them. So I think we're still -- the way we present it is we're still on discussion with surface, and there's a lot more work to do.
Ittai KidronOppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division · Managing Director
Interesting. So -- but again, at the core of all this correction from, Olivier, is the data platform, right? That's what it really enables all of this optionality on top of the platform.
Olivier PomelDatadog, Inc. · Co-Founder, CEO & Director
Yes, it's the data platform and the fact that the whole product is targeting a very broad set of users. It's not -- we never built it as a specialist product, something that, in fact, people use all day long, but everybody else is scared of. We've built it as something that should appeal to every single engineer, every single product manager, every single business analyst.
Ittai KidronOppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division · Managing Director
Got it. So I guess, if I had to put you on the spot here and ask you if you had to use one word to define your company, what are you? An observability company? A security company? How would you define yourself?
Olivier PomelDatadog, Inc. · Co-Founder, CEO & Director
Well, one word is going to be difficult. But the way we see it is -- what we aim to be is the platform that stands between the humans and the [ bits ] in the enterprise. Basically, everything that has to do with understanding the applications, building the applications, securing the applications, understanding what they are doing for the business.
And by the way, if the business is digital, the application is the business, therefore understanding the business itself. That's what we aim to be. You can think of it as the nervous system for the digital enterprise system.
Ittai KidronOppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division · Managing Director
Got it. Okay. That's a great way to define it. All right. So going back to the core, where we started, the infrastructure, how much of that is still the most common landing spot with new customers?
And can you talk about the balance of the revenue mix between infrastructure and the rest of your business right now? How has it changed? And if you and I will talk 2 years from now, what would you expect it to be?
Olivier PomelDatadog, Inc. · Co-Founder, CEO & Director
Yes. So we -- this is still a product we lean with, infrastructure. And we see it in most of our new levels. It doesn't necessarily have to be this way that we've seen. Some other products can also lend themselves to being great new logo drivers. For example, synthetic testing tends to be like -- it can actually be a great stand-alone readable product.
However, we haven't seen a need to mess with what's working. It's a very big trend of sales force to align the marketing on lending new logos with the infrastructure monitoring product. It also is a product that sets ourselves very well for growth because it tends to be the [ preferred ] tool in the environment, has a large surface of contact and is a great basis for expanding to other products after that.
So it's still mostly what we live with. And we see no reason to mess with that too much, even though we're experimenting a little bit with the ways we think we can generate more growth by having other products in the mix as well.
We -- in terms of the revenue mix, so 4 years ago, it was pretty much all of the revenue. Today, we didn't disclose the exact mix, but we said in the last call that the other products like log management, APM, et cetera, were about [ $150 ] million in revenue. So what this tells you is that infrastructure, if you zoom out, but very broadly, it's about half of the business. And it's -- the rest of it is growing a little bit faster, but infrastructure is still growing fast.
So moving forward, it's going to be a smaller and smaller proportion of our revenue. But we don't really care so much like when you -- in terms of where the revenue comes from the observability side because we think that there is a -- the category themselves are very backwards looking.
But there's quite a bit of fungibility between them in terms of how you can solve the [indiscernible] consolidating with infrastructure monitoring sometimes, sometimes you can consolidate with APM, sometimes with logs, sometimes it doesn't matter. So it's too hard about that, but we see it mostly as the correct line in product, the basis for the business on top of which we -- what we spend.
Ittai KidronOppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division · Managing Director
Got it. As we think about market adoption so far, if I try to think about your new business in any given quarter and perhaps how much of that new business is a displacement versus a greenfield as sort of an indicator perhaps for the -- just broadly speaking, right, the adoption of these types of tools within customers, how much of your business of new business in the quarter is still a greenfield versus a displacement?
Olivier PomelDatadog, Inc. · Co-Founder, CEO & Director
The majority of it is greenfield. And when we say greenfield, it means it doesn't displace another product at scale. It might -- it always does, to a certain extent, complement or displace some open source and do-it-yourself, because everybody, every single customer has that somewhere.
And the reason we do it -- like we actually keep it this way. We're focused on greenfield because the whole market is transitioning. Everybody new -- everybody is new to it, [ understanding ] small. And also, it's the best way to -- or was the best use of the sales team's time, basically.
But yes, we win a number of displacements. We mentioned them on the earnings calls. But they tend to consume more energy than going after the greenfield. So in the end, if you think in terms of productivity per dollar spent on the sales and marketing side, you get much better returns from [ publishing ] on the green space.
Ittai KidronOppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division · Managing Director
Got it. Well, it'd be fair to say that while a lot of new business is greenfield, a lot of perhaps expansion is brownfield?
Olivier PomelDatadog, Inc. · Co-Founder, CEO & Director
It's true, yes. You will see that as customers expand, especially as they're getting deferment to the term migrations, they're going to retire some of the tools they were using before or stop expanding some of those tools and extend with us instead to come by. That's definitely [ different ].
Ittai KidronOppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division · Managing Director
Okay. Now I want to talk about your module approach. Again, you've added all of these capabilities that you went through. There's a very large list of things that you do right now. Do you feel, though, is there a risk where just growing the list of capabilities and products could create either customer confusion, on some level, could undermine perhaps your ability to penetrate within customers? How do you keep people focused? I guess, that's the question, and make sure that they'll get lost in the shuffle of all of this stuff.
And then second, I guess, you're still clearly evolving the product. But what if, Olivier, you and I talked 2 years from now, and it's actually the number shrinks because things get consolidated and streamlined to just to facilitate better, faster adoption.
Olivier PomelDatadog, Inc. · Co-Founder, CEO & Director
Yes. So there's 2 sides to the number of volumes. One is the demand side and the customer, and are already dealing with that. And there, I would say, we have the luxury of being able to look at what the platform providers have done.
Like if you look at the U.S., they have the magnitude of more SKUs than we do. And it seems to be working fine for them. And by the way, the customer is the same, he likes the sort of these products are being adopted. And you see them being at scale to the tens of billions of dollars in revenue and growing at higher rates. So I think they're not being held back by that on that much. That's on the demand side.
On our side, what we get from having all these different modules, and there's different SKUs, is that we get extremely clear signal on where the value is most working or is not working. So when we shift the functionality, in fact, with customer SKU, these customers buy it. If they paid for it, if they expand with it, we know it's working. If there's so much strain from it, if they don't want to pay for it when we start charging for it, then we're not giving value.
And it is how -- as a company, that you can expand in many directions with many new products. This is how we keep ourselves harnessed, basically. This is how we know we're working on things that actually matter. The track, otherwise, I mean, it's very easy to fall into is to build the good stuff and not have any idea anymore, what's good there and what's not good there [indiscernible].
Ittai KidronOppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division · Managing Director
Got it. Okay. So very interesting. All right. I want to dive a little bit into cloud security, which is a relatively new area for you. You have posture management, cloud workload protection and cloud seam. You've recently expanded into application security monitoring, and you just bought an API security, if I remember, just last week.
Help me think about -- so what has been the adoption of these solutions so far? But this seems to be a push in the industry towards a CNAPP type of architecture around this. Do you share the same view from an architecture standpoint? And if so, what are some of the missing gaps you have right now in order to deliver on that vision?
Olivier PomelDatadog, Inc. · Co-Founder, CEO & Director
Well, so the field is evolving fairly quickly on the cost security side. I would say, one specificity of security is that there are a lot more acronyms and vision, they change a lot more quickly than on the -- than we decide. So we have to invest more outside of layers on our end for that.
The CNAPP is, I would say, the new, we refer, category that is emerging. I don't think it's super clear yet with what it encompasses and what it doesn't. But what seems to be clear is that customers are trying to respond to it, and they understand that they need it. So it's possible that we refrain some of things we do in terms of holding the right to CNAPP artillery in the future.
But in terms of where we are today, we have to build up a long build on security. There's enough -- the problem is so vast that we know there's a number of areas we need to cover. There are some we covered very well today, and we have -- we mentioned in previous calls that we have thousands of customers, paying customers, on our security offering. We see very high growth on the [indiscernible] from a small base, and we get a lot of customer pool there.
What we hear from our customers, though, is that there's a ton more they want us to build there. There is more frameworks and cloud vendors and products they want us to support in terms of our coverage. There's more flexibility they need in the rules and what they can do with them. They're for automation. They know on the -- what they can do with them, there's more coverage, which is why you see us do things like buying this -- big API security company, Seekret.
Customers need more, and they're giving us the tool we need. So we're very, very happy with the situation we're in right now, where we have this very clear signal from them. It's clear, the intent to use us. This clear revenue stream with them, and we can do this deal with them. It's very similar to what we've experienced when we're building the infrastructure management product back in the days.
Ittai KidronOppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division · Managing Director
Got it. It's interesting. I guess, along those lines, Olivier, it's clear that it's important for you to cover the entire cycle, meaning the dip side and the run side, right, of application security. Because you've had the [ SCA ] and [ IASM ] and RASP through acquisitions as well. And so help me think about the connection of the dev and the run time from an application security standpoint, but also maybe perhaps you can add later on top of that.
From a go-to-market standpoint, are these -- everybody's talked about DevOps, when in reality, most organizations is still separate or parts running. So how much does your go-to-market needs to evolve in order to address this? Are you just going to have to wait until the market to come to you? Or do you need to kind of straddle both sides of the equation here?
Olivier PomelDatadog, Inc. · Co-Founder, CEO & Director
Yes. So on the first question, it's very important to cover the dev side. And we actually think our differentiation in the -- I mean, there's a couple of things we differentiate on basically aside. But one of them is that we think to actually solve the problem, you can't just rely on security engineers because there are not enough of them. You need to rely on the ops folks and on the dev folks, which means you need to cover the whole spectrum between what the ops team and the dev team is doing and the security aspects of product environment.
So that's why we're investing in the full stack, not just the posture management or the CNAPP side of things, but also application security and how to analyze the data of the engine.
We also differentiate, by the way, on the lack of friction in terms of instrumenting everything because we have all the instrumentation underneath. So our customers don't need to spend time expanding the applications for security purposes. They'll need to build performance stacks because they are going to intercept data one more time. They also don't need to pay data tax by sending that same design to another place. So we say we can easily be more efficient at the future security efforts for that.
In terms of the go-to-market, I mean, you've clearly identified the fact that the buyer can be a little bit different there. So for everything we've done today, the buyer was largely the same person who is paying the deposit [indiscernible].
In security, you might have a lot of that falling under -- on the CISO. And it comes with -- even though the needs are going to be the same, it comes often with a bit of a different language that we need to see here. So as we keep building the product and as we keep interacting more and more with that side of the shop, we also are building our go-to-market team to focus on that part of the [ one ].
The first signs of that, as you'll see, is that we started different blogs in different research teams to focus on security. So we have a blog right now that publishes our own research on security. That's something new. That's something that happened a few weeks ago. And we'll be investing more on that side to associate on their own language more, with the exception of Seekret.
Ittai KidronOppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division · Managing Director
Got it. That's interesting. From a partnership standpoint, what I find interesting is that in your space, right, in your core space from observability, you don't really need to interoperate much with your competitors' tools. But I find that link in security, it's a slightly different animal. So when you think about companies that operate in the app security space like -- I don't know, like a Snyk or like a Sysdig on container security, do you envision partnerships on the security side evolving here? Are they going to be a little bit more important to either, a, bringing you a little bit more credibility also in this space, but also filling in gaps, which naturally will take you some time to fill up?
Olivier PomelDatadog, Inc. · Co-Founder, CEO & Director
Well, we were also integrating with everybody else, and then some. I mean, we've done that on the observability side, too. That's when we started. We're mostly integrating with our products in terms of data we were getting before we had first-line solutions for a lot of the other use cases in recovery. And we're still doing it today.
When we think of automating response to incident, that we actually need to integrate with everything our customers have, so yes, then we integrate. Again, we hate to be the nervous system for our customers, but we see some parts of what they use connected to what we [ go after ].
Ittai KidronOppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division · Managing Director
Got it. Okay. Shifting to the R&D side. You're clearly in a very good position, and you're profitable at scale. You're spending about 30%, plus/minus, right, of revenue on R&D. Help me think about the balance of that investment between innovation, new products versus kind of maintaining some of your existing solutions that have been existing for some time.
Olivier PomelDatadog, Inc. · Co-Founder, CEO & Director
So nothing is in [indiscernible], everything is in -- everything is being aggressively developed right now. Because we think, even in infrastructure monitoring, we're still very early. The world is changing quickly. As in the middle of the game, we know since we started the company, that there are multiple transitions within the transition. You'll retain from -- would come from a -- VMs to cloud instances, switching to containers, several layers, now maybe to some edge, several layers. I think there's all these things that are happening that require continued investment and continued evolution of the product. So everything is being actually developed.
The way we think about it is not so much in terms of a brand-new products versus existing products. It's more in terms of would a fraction of our engineering investment go into the platform and what goes to new products. It's about half and half.
Like about half of the -- that's actually for the teams organized. Half of the team is organized on the underlying platform and everything that is shared with new products. And the other half is working on SKU-specific products. This is what we call use case-specific developments.
Ittai KidronOppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division · Managing Director
Got it. Okay. Well, clearly, you're doing extremely well over there from an innovation standpoint. Let's talk about competition. Some of your competitors have had more challenges recently. Can we think about what you see out there in the marketplace?
And clearly, you're running at a very fast pace. But how much time do you really spend -- or an effort do you make in trying to find the customers of those companies specifically and try to kind of target and more aggressively try to displace versus just keep head down and running doing what you're doing with your -- a lot of the greenfield adoption?
Olivier PomelDatadog, Inc. · Co-Founder, CEO & Director
So we keep running mostly on the greenfield. Again, it's more efficient from a DORA's in, DORA's out perspective or timing DORA's out perspective. And that's more of a granular long-term success. Also, it's -- I personally think it's a bad idea to try and go and specifically unsafe careers. Because we, thanks to the only few, if you try to force it, it is that it brings your product too close to your [indiscernible] products.
Because what you do is you go talk to one customer and yes, they want your product because you product's better. But they'll say, "Well, because this feature, I'm using this old product that we like, you need to give me now a figure, so up to you." So you'll do it. And then you'll repeat it for another 15 customers. Then it will end up with you getting your computer product as opposed to building your own future and where you might need to go.
So if you try to force it, it has negative side effects than upgrade. That being said, when it comes from customers themselves, when they are the ones comes to realization that, "I need to standardize. I'm sick and tired of what I had before. It's not delivering what I need to deliver. I want to send it out on you. That's a very different conversation. And that's a conversation we're very happy to have with them.
Ittai KidronOppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division · Managing Director
Got it. That's great. Okay. Let's talk about the more recent results, a great quarter last week. But you've also -- you started talking about some softness that you're seeing. Maybe you can be a little bit more specific about what are the changes that you've seen from a macro standpoint out there in the field?
Olivier PomelDatadog, Inc. · Co-Founder, CEO & Director
Yes. So what we saw is, for some markets in our base, especially the customers that spend more money on us, so in this session, I think the point we said for any of the -- these customers was customers that spend [ 1.5 million on us ], we saw that they were still growing, but they were growing a little bit slower than they have been historically. And there has been a lot of consistency historically in terms of customer growth.
And to us, it -- what it does, it's really driven by the rate of migration to public clouds [indiscernible] in the right of digital transformation. Like there seems to be some background constant rate at which companies are moving. That had been true for the past 4 or 5 years. And that's very constant. We've seen some of these customers fall a little below that. We haven't seen it in April. We saw it in May and June. And when we -- and by the way, we put a little bit in July, but I think it's too early to declare victory on that.
And when we zoom in a little bit, what we see is that those customers, what they're doing is they're optimizing a little bit, and they'll use it on the edge. And when we say optimize, it's actually something that we see all the time with customers. Like everybody has this pattern with us where they go -- they consume more and more. They point to the cloud, and they could see more product. And then every 6 months or every year, they look back, they appeal. And they're seeing -- they're trying to find if there's any ways or anything that's using. We refer to it on the call as tying of loose ends.
But what happens when we've had macro events such as in the very beginning of COVID or what we saw over the last couple of months is that we see many customers do it at the same time. So instead of canceling each other, like we see, we have this shared slowdown, I would say, across customers.
It's different than what we've seen in COVID because it's not as pronounced. That during COVID, we had a sharp flattening from everyone at the same time. But that was also very short-lived. Things started growing very quickly again right after that. This [indiscernible] as widespread because it's considerably across the larger customers and even more so in commercials. And it's not as pronounced. It's a slowdown but not flattening. But we also don't know what that's going to -- how long it's going to last, I mean, if it is driven by macro fears. In most cases, it's years that our customers' businesses are -- instead of slowing down, but they're being more cautious. We don't know how long these fears are going to last.
Ittai KidronOppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division · Managing Director
Got it. It sounds like if I'm interpreting your comments here is that you're actually not entirely sure that this is macro related, fair?
Olivier PomelDatadog, Inc. · Co-Founder, CEO & Director
Well, I mean, look, we cannot be completely sure. However, the tenure of the conversion with customers is that when we hear -- I think, definitely, what they're doing is it's mostly -- they got a note from their CFO saying, we don't know what the future's going to be made of, so let's be really careful. I'm going to look very carefully at every deal and do whatever you can to sell the company money.
Ittai KidronOppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division · Managing Director
So you don't think that it's a possibility that since this has happened with the large customers, that perhaps you've just breached the natural limits of your footprint within some of those customers. And they've just -- I guess, their rate of growth is, by definition, slowing down?
Olivier PomelDatadog, Inc. · Co-Founder, CEO & Director
No, it's not the case because it affects them. Someone's been dependent on their level of scale with us, about a certain point. The reason why we think it affect large customers than the smaller ones is that -- it doesn't make sense to spend time optimizing to, say, $5,000, but it makes sense to spend optimizing to, say, $0.5 million.
Ittai KidronOppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division · Managing Director
Right.
Olivier PomelDatadog, Inc. · Co-Founder, CEO & Director
Because in both cases, that time spent is spent by someone who was costing the company like that $0.25 million to $0.5 million [ a year ].
Ittai KidronOppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division · Managing Director
Got it. Okay. So when I take that, help me think about your hiring plans. Clearly still growing at a very fast pace, even your guidance as is continues to suggest very strong growth ahead, well ahead of your competitors, what is this doing, if anything, to your hiring plans through the rest of the year?
Olivier PomelDatadog, Inc. · Co-Founder, CEO & Director
We haven't changed our hiring plans. So we're growing as fast as we think we can without breaking the system by breaking our engineering teams or where the market is, which, when we were growing 85% year-over-year, we're still only growing this year 40%, 50%, 60% year-over-year. I think, now, we'll hold to that.
The thing to remember is, we are very efficient by nature. I think [ about ] breakeven before it was cool. We [ got ] almost nothing on our way from, essentially, to IPO. We've been generating lot of cash since then. So we'll be disciplined, like we won't do weird things. We shouldn't expect -- investors shouldn't expect us to, all of a sudden, start earning cash like crazy.
But we think we're in a position where, because we're so efficient and we have high growth, we can invest in a way that the rest of the field cannot, and we can further pull away from the pack. So we don't intend to slow down on that, unless things get really tricky in the market.
Ittai KidronOppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division · Managing Director
Got it. So is it fair to say, Olivier, that right here, right now, you would prefer another point of growth to another point of margin?
Olivier PomelDatadog, Inc. · Co-Founder, CEO & Director
Yes. Definitely, yes, especially because that growth is going to compound. And tomorrow's margin is going to be much happier if we [indiscernible]. I think we've proven already by looking at the past few quarters that we are inherently efficient and profitable business, that we could actually grow at a very high rate while being very comfortable. And so we're not worried about that.
What we want to do is make sure that we live up to a full potential in terms of the market opportunity without locking bad habits on the way, right? What's most important to us is not to start developing bad habits as a [ better ] company.
Ittai KidronOppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division · Managing Director
Got it. All right. One more for me before I take some from the crowd, which is your cloud partnerships. AWS was a long-standing one that has done very well for you, but you've developed others as well. Now when we think about -- how important are those relationships and drive new business? And in what way are your relationship with the cloud guys different or unique versus some of your competitors?
Olivier PomelDatadog, Inc. · Co-Founder, CEO & Director
Well, I mean, look, we -- we're the most associated with their success. And when the customer is moving to the product, we're the #1 name for that. So we make -- we've helped our providers to be successful as well by making those deployments successful and having these customers grow faster with them.
So we do have a great relationship with the cloud providers. We are -- like we have partnerships with all of them. They're all similar in some ways and different in other ways. And they all have things that are working very well and things that are -- maybe broken that we need to fix and that we're investing in.
So we'd say, it's a work in progress with all of the cloud providers. But let's say, it's something that we spend a lot of time on.
Ittai KidronOppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division · Managing Director
Would you say that level of partnership with all the cloud is about the same? Or some stand out for you more than others?

[ Claims arrest ]. So sometimes, we get a little bit ahead with one, and then we catch with the other one wants to catch up with us. And we -- so we -- it varies a little bit over time. But overall, it's no mystery that we're still heavier on in the U.S. than in the other cloud, but the other clouds are growing faster with us. So that's sort of the dynamic we have today.

Got it. Excellent. All right. We have one question from the audience, which goes into a little bit more of an ROI type of question. What would be the typical or average reduction in a customer's bill after they optimize their APM and logging volumes?
Olivier PomelDatadog, Inc. · Co-Founder, CEO & Director
That really depends on the customer and what they're finding. But the way to think about it is they might shave 5%, 10%, 20% of their PO and which might mean they are flattened for a couple of months, so they go down a little bit for months and then they cycle in again. And that's what we've seen throughout the history of the product.
Ittai KidronOppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division · Managing Director
Got it. But Olivier, maybe you can walk us through, what does optimizing really mean? Like what is it that, as a customer, I'm not doing, but suddenly, I can do in order to squeeze a little bit more of the orange?
Olivier PomelDatadog, Inc. · Co-Founder, CEO & Director
I tell you, so what this means is, at all level, they look at -- they're saying that they're not using or that is lower value, but it is costing them lots of money. So for example, they might find that they're paying a lot for a system that is not business people, and they've been very techy. So they might get some of that. Or they might find that the Sunday loggers turned on some large amounts of debug logging, and they might decide that they can actually sample economic [indiscernible], and that's enough.
And that's perfectly healthy. And we actually invest heavily in building more tools for customers to understand exactly what brings value to them and give them more leverage. They can adjust how much is every key, how much is sample, for how long they keep it, for what use case is, things like that. So that's -- some of the things they can do.
All the things they can do that also come in to these optimization that are 1 level up from us are optimizing some of their workloads in their [indiscernible]. Sometimes, you might find that they have 1 application, 1 environment that is to launch, and we can download a little bit because it's not as well as it could be. Or sometimes, you have found that somebody forgot to turn off the machines, and it happens on the back scale.
You think, after all these years, in all these tooling, everybody will turn everything off the right way. Well, that's not the case. So you'll find some of that -- you're finding always on an ongoing basis. And whenever it gets higher is could you really see more of it happening in [indiscernible].

Got it. That makes sense. Okay. I want to make sure we're still on time. So I'll ask you one last question from you, which is what do you think is the most misunderstood or underappreciated component of Datadog?
Olivier PomelDatadog, Inc. · Co-Founder, CEO & Director
Well, look, often, we end up being [ broke-down ] in the -- what does competition look like today or what do we think about the user growth for the next few quarters [ and all that ]. To us, most of that is almost irrelevant because the way we see it is, we're extremely early in the gigantic opportunity. Everybody is transforming. Everybody's becoming a digital business. Most of that is going to be in some part of some sort of the public [ profile ], most of that is. And the complexity that companies have to deal with them as they go into the world is shooting up like crazy.
So for us, there's absolutely no doubt that there is a massive, massive opportunity to be the real platform there. And that's what we're building towards. So that's why we're aggressively building more products. That's also why we focus so much on the greenfield as opposed to -- and seeking what we can in the white spaces, in particular. We think that there's such a big opportunity there. So that's -- I would say, that's the one where we want to leave everybody with.
